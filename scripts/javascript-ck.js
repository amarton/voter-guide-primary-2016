Meanwhile, big corporations are finding ways to avoid paying their fair share in state taxes: Nineteen of Maryland’s 50 largest corporations didn’t pay any corporate income taxes in tax year 2011. That’s wrong. If I could make only one change to Maryland’s tax laws, it would be to institute combined reporting, which prevents big corporations from cheating our state tax system by transferring profits to subsidiaries in other states. Combined reporting will return to the state $92-144 million in tax revenue.",q1p2:"<p>I propose using this added revenue – and the over $1 billion of savings I have identified in my “People’s Money” plan – to increase investments in education and the economy, hold the line on new tax increases, and cut taxes in ways that grow jobs and our tax base. For example, I have proposed a gradual reduction in our corporate income tax rate, which is significantly higher than Virginia’s, starting with a 0.25 percent decrease in my first year in office. That reduction will be more than paid for by adopting combined reporting, and additional reductions will be linked to job growth in Maryland.</p><p>Many more changes are needed to improve Maryland’s tax laws, which have not been fully reviewed since 1983. As Governor I will create a commission to review state taxes and make recommendations for greater efficiency and enhanced return on investment.</p>",q2p1:"I fully support this goal. To achieve it, we need to make changes at every educational level, starting by offering high-quality, full-day pre-Kindergarten. I was the first gubernatorial candidate to propose a universal pre-K plan focused on getting our neediest kids full-day pre- K.",q2p2:"<p>At the elementary-school level, we need to ensure our kids are getting quality instruction. I have proposed a Governor’s Teacher Corps to bring outstanding new teachers into high- need elem entary schools, pairing them with exceptional teacher m entors and giving them student loan assistance if they teach in these schools for three years. I have also proposed a “Maryland Matters” Volunteer Corps to offer support for children at risk of falling behind.</p><p>At the high-school level, we need to make sure our kids graduate ready for college. Right now more than half of Maryland’s college-bound students will require some sort of remedial education. That’s not acceptable. I have proposed a “Strong Start” contract that holds high schools accountable for providing students access to the coursework they need to be college and career ready when they graduate high school.</p><p>To help more high school graduates enroll in college and graduate ready to fill jobs in the global economy, I have proposed discounting college tuition for degree programs in high- demand occupations like cybersecurity and health care. For those wanting instead to pursue professional certification, I have proposed a robust, statewide career and technological apprenticeship program that enables them to complete a rigorous career program while earning their high school diploma.</p>"},brown={q1p1:"Brown 1",q1p2:"Brown 2",q2p1:"Brown 1",q2p2:"Brown 2"},mizeur={q1p1:"mizeur 1",q1p2:"mizeur 2"},craig={q1p1:"craig 1",q1p2:"craig 2"},george={q1p1:"george 1",q1p2:"george 2"},hogan={q1p1:"hogan 1",q1p2:"hogan 2"},lollar={q1p1:"lollar 1",q1p2:"lollar 2"},app={init:function(){app.news_animation();app.questionnaire_nav();app.toggle_answers()},news_animation:function(){$("#news ul li").hover(function(){$("#news ul li").addClass("faded");$(this).removeClass("faded")},function(){$("#news ul li").removeClass("faded")})},questionnaire_nav:function(){var e;$("#questionnaire-nav ul li").hover(function(){clearTimeout(default_text);$("#questionnaire-nav div").html($(this).attr("data-subject"))},function(){default_text=setTimeout(function(){$("#questionnaire-nav div").html("Jump to:")},1e3)});$("#questionnaire-nav ul li").click(function(){$.scrollTo($("#question-"+$(this).html()),800)})},load_answer:function(e,t){$("#question-"+e).find(".answer-headshot").attr("src","images/candidates-no-bg/"+t+".jpg");$("#question-"+e).find(".speaker").html(t.charAt(0).toUpperCase()+t.slice(1));$("#question-"+e).find(".first-para").html(window[t]["q"+e+"p1"]);$("#question-"+e).find(".other-paras").append(window[t]["q"+e+"p2"])},load_all_answers:function(e){for(var t=1;t<=2;t++)app.load_answer(t,e)},toggle_answers:function(){$(".question-candidates ul li").click(function(){var e=$(this).attr("data-q"),t=$(this).attr("data-cand");$("#question-"+e).find(".other-paras").html("");app.load_answer(e,t);$(this).parent().find("li").removeClass("selected");$(this).addClass("selected")})}};$(document).ready(function(){app.init()});
