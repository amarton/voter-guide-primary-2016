    "q1":"This was a poorly negotiated agreement that had no realistic chance of succeeding, with a country that already had a reputation of violating such agreements. It is no surprise that they have already violated the prohibition on ballistic missile testing. That's why I voted against the agreement, and believe we should immediately \"snap back\" sanctions.</p>",
    "q2":"We should consider a declaration of war on ISIS. They have promised our destruction. SInce they have already declared themselves as a caliphate - a nation-state - we should form a coalition to defeat them as we would any other serious international enemy that threatens to destroy us.</p>",
    "q3":"The TPP is a very complicated agreement. It will take months to determine all the potential ramifications included in it before it even comes up for a vote in Congress. I am troubled by what I know of it so far - it cedes too much authority over a wide variety of issues to international adjudication, and I would vote against it at this time.</p>",
    "q4":"The main promise of the Affordable Care ACt - affordability - has not been delivered. Infact, teh opposite has happened for millions of American. We need to repeal most of the Act. Retain the coverage for people with pre-existing conditions (as we had here in Maryland before the ACA), allow coverage for children up to age 25 on their parents' policy (as we had here in Maryland before ACA), and retain the elimination of annual caps on coverage (since modern cancer therapies and other therapies could easily exceed the limits that were allowed before the ACA). We must allow lower cost policies to be available - the costs of policies under ACA have risen too fast. Finally, we need to institute real cost-saving measures to bring down the cost of health care (not just health care insurance) by allowing patients to become more involved in health spending decisions through a variety of mechanisms that would lower cost while maintaining quality.</p>",
    "q5":"The Dodd-Frank law, though well-intentioned, has had the effect of destroying small and community banks throughout the First District. By insuring banks \"too big to fail\", the law has had the unintended effect of allowing only large banks to survive, and take risks that threaten a repeat of 2008.</p>",
    "q6":"Although President Obama was historic as the first African-American president, the President has failed on many fronts - race relations have worsened, health care costs rose, median family income fell, we feel less safe in our homes and in our country, and rancor between the our political parties has increased, not decreased. Our federal debt is now more than $55,000 for every man, woman, and child in America. Unfortunately, this is the Obama legacy.</p>",
    "q7":"I don not support an increase in the minimum wage. With teenage unemployment, especially among minorities, at near record highs, now is not the time to destroy entry level jobs with an increase in the minimum wage, especially for young workers. Likewise, the federal government should not be increasing regulations on our employers and job-creators by requiring paid sick time or paid family leave.</p>",
    "q8":"Congress must protect the individual right to keep and bear arms guaranteed in the Second Amendment. We should, however, modernize and reform our mental health delivery system to treat those individuals who have serious mental health issues and might resort to violence, including gun violence.</p>",
    "q9":"This issue should be handled at both the state and the federal level. The Congressional district lines in Maryland are the laughing-stock of the entire country. I support Governor Hogan's efforts to reform our re-districting system, and would support amending the U.S. Constitution to the same end.</p>",
    "q10":"As the son of immigrants who has benefited from all this country offered my parents, my brothers, and my children, I am running to help restore America's greatness.</p>"

    "q1":"Our recent agreement with Iran, the successful prisoner swap, and Iran's release of American sailors all show that diplomacy is possible. The nuclear agreement reinforces sanctions for human rights abuses, support of terrorism, and the pursuit of missile technology. The deal encourages moderate elements within Iran, discourages pursuit of nuclear weapons, and includes provisions to re-implement sanctions if Iran fails to uphold their promises.</p>",
    "q2":"ISIS is not just a threat to the security of the United States and its allies, but to the lives of all of the people who are subjected to its oppressive regime. The fight is against religious extremists, not against Muslim people seeking freedom from persecution. We must make sure that ISIS cannot achieve its goal of a caliphate in Iraq and Syria, and this means we must aid refugees and asylum seekers who wish to escape terror and persecution. ISIS wants us to turn our backs on our fellow humans, but we said 'never again'. First and foremost, our intelligence and national security agencies must destroy their ability to fund this campaign of terror. We must continue airstrikes to support the Iraqi efforts to dislodge ISIS from their strongholds. Saudi Arabia- which has the largest military of any Arab state in the region- must lead a coalition to combat terrorism. America cannot tolerate rogue elements engaging in illegal oil trading with ISIS, and I fully support ongoing strikes against oil infrastructure.</p>",
    "q3":"Like NAFTA, TPP will continue to export American jobs overseas, and I would have opposed the agreement. TPP trades away the ability to create jobs, trades away the government's enforcement of labor safeguards, and includes toothless dispute mechanisms that always favor corporations over workers. The U.S. must level the playing field when opening markets around the world. Trade deals must stop using low worker pay as the deciding factor to do business in foreign countries. The people in the rooms negotiating these agreements must make the spread of democracy compatible with the protection of American workers and the expansion of our middle class.</p>",
    "q4":"It could take a great deal of work and political maneuvering to perfect the ACA. All too often the cheapest plans have the largest deductibles. Also, we must address the \"family glitch\" when only one person in the household works and is not offered family coverage by their employer, which affects 4.3 million people. Large numbers of lower Eastern Shore residents signed up for new coverage, yet the Maryland Health Exchange says there is room for big gains south of Rt. 301 all the way to the Virginia line to sign up thousands more. More than 365,000 people in Maryland have already begun paying for health insurance through the ACA that didn't have health insurance before. My opponent wants to take away this health insurance from these newly-covered Marylanders. I seek to expand that coverage.</p>",
    "q5":"After WWII the American economy grew, wages were on the rise, the middle class had many opportunities and a great deal of purchasing power, while the working class had access to union protections, living wages, and the possibility of upward mobility. We are still reeling from the repercussions of decades of deregulation. The steps the Congress and the Obama Administration took to regulate Wall Street were not enough. Congress and the next administration will need to do more. American families are taking the hit for banks and corporations that are \"too big to fail\". If a bank is too big to fail, it's too big, period. We need to regulate Wall Street, make corporations pay their fair share of taxes heavily block for off shore tax haven loopholes, and bail out the everyday people who were taken advantage of before the recession. Until big banks and corporate financial institutions are made smaller as to fall under Dodd-Frank, America will still be in danger of another full scale economic meltdown.</p>",
    "q6":"The ACA is the law of the land, and has had its legality affirmed twice by a conservative Supreme Court. Marriage equality is the law of the land, affirmed by a conservative Supreme Court. We have over 70 straight months of job growth and unemployment below 5%. The failure of the past eight years is that the partisan divide has widened. The President acknowledged this in the State of the Union. The refusal of Congress to find common ground with the Administration has not solved the heroin problem, income inequality or the problems of the Chesapeake Bay. We need more people in Congress willing to make a difference, not just make a point.</p>",
    "q7":"The Federal Minimum Wage should be linked to inflation and the purchasing power of the dollar, and I support an incremental increase to $10.10 an hour. A single mother of one child working full-time at the current minimum wage falls below the poverty line, and that's if she's fortunate enough to get 40 hours a week every week of the year. While corporations have record profits and the stock market climbs, the real value of the minimum wage is falling each year. Our economic growth will be strangled if the working class does not have sufficient purchasing power. Maryland will increase the state minimum wage to $10.10 as of 2018, so opposing a Federal wage of the same will put First District workers at a disadvantage. Paid sick time and family leave make better workers and stronger families.</p>",
    "q8":"We must close the loophole for the suspected terrorists in the U.S. who can apply for and get a gun. Background checks, increased mental health funding, and marijuana decriminalization will lead to fewer deaths. We can uphold the rights of hunters and sportsmen while decreasing violence in our communities at the same time. I'm against illegal guns and will continue to work with crime control advocates using the laws we already have at the federal, state and local levels to decrease violence as I did as mayor of Salisbury.</p>",
    "q9":"I live where I live, and that is in Maryland's First Congressional District. If that changes due to the Supreme Court demanding that change, then I will run in the newly formed First Congressional District. Complaining about the size of it, or how it was drawn makes no sense until we know if the court demands a change. From Taneytown to Elkton Salisbury to Pocomoke City is a long way, but I know how to get from one to the other. All across the district, people don't seem too worried about lines on a map. They just want a Congress that works and a Congressman they can count on. Ultimately, this is a decision for the states to handle. I am not in favor of congressional overreach when there is so much work to be done that is already the responsibility of Congress.</p>",
    "q10":"I am running for Congress in Maryland's first congressional district because the people in my district deserve someone who will work for them. Everyday people are struggling simply to make ends meet, and the incumbent more often than not is absent in his role to serve this district. When he does act, it is all too often to simply say \"no.\" I absolutely can and will do better, because the people of Maryland's Eastern Shore deserve nothing less. Maryland and the First District deserve someone in Congress who will make a difference, not just make a point.</p>"

    "q1":"We need to engage Iran and bring them back into the world and this agreement starts that and does help prevent nuclear proliferation.</p>",
    "q2":"We need to cut off its source of funding. Bring together a coalition of allies in the middle east. The instability in the middle east has to be stemmed. The USA needs to maintain a active role in the middle east however we do not have to intervene militaryUpgrade our visa program and tracking of people that go to the middle east. Russia and China should also be brought into the coalition of nations to battle isis.America needs to provide military aid and intelligence to the allies. We should help train and equip troops for our allies. isis is not a religion we are not at war with Islam. We need to build relationships and have respect for are allies. have respect for Islam . Also bring in the kerds and help them build a state. There needs to be a realignment of the borders in the middle east. .</p>",
    "q3":"No I do not. We cannot have free and fair trade with nations that can enslave its people , have little to no environmental laws and low standards. America should help raise the standard of living and freedom and promote democracy around the world. We should not just have a race to the bottom to get the most for the least and help drive all new wealth to the 1 percent. Free Trade deals have not be very good for the vast majority of americans or for our national defense. Also for the most part they have help the few and powerful exploit people from around the world. Free trade has not provided the people of china with more freedom . They have a little more money and a great deal of pollution and exploration. The communist elites have grown rich and there military has gained more power and has become more a threat to america with there increased wealth.</p>",
    "q4":"Open up the insurance market beyond state lines. Have more competition. Streamline the administration process. Do more to control drug cost and bring in more medical professionals.</p>",
    "q5":"Yes they where appropriate , we need more regulation of the market. We need to bring on the level of regulation that we had before the deregulation boom of the 80's and 90's.</p>",
    "q6":"President Obama started the reform of health care. There has been a need to reform health care for 40 years and every year the need grew. He created the first positive step and now I see us moving for more protection and change. I feel the start of health care reform was the presidents greatest accomplishment.</p>",
    "q7":"If the minimum wage would have keep up with inflation it would be around $17 per hour. In 1972 it was $1.40. The tunnel toll was .25cents . Now its $4. The higher wage would not cost jobs and would stimulate the economy. With so many working people making the minimum and working in poverty. America spends money on food stamps and social programs. People should not work full time and remain in poverty. With the higher wage there will be less need for government programs. Yes paid sick time helps everyone. It keeps america health. Family leave also is important and it is a humane thing. It helps build a more secure work life.</p>",
    "q8":"More money for mental health and community outreach. There should be a concerted effort to place violent people in jail. Less effaces on non-violent drug offenders.More support to local law enforcement.</p>",
    "q9":"For real democracy we need a non-partisan federal commission to redraw and redo the federal congressional districts.</p>",
    "q10":"Because I feel I have the temperament and judgement to best represent Maryland in Congress.</p>"

First of All I Don't Trust a Country that is over there Chanting Death to America. IRAN should Never have a Nuclear Bomb period! I will do everything I can to stop IRAN from ever getting to that point witch places a Nuclear Bomb in the hands of the Iranians. Congress could have Stopped the lifting of the Sanctions and they Totally LET us Americans Down!</p>",

I want All three Branches of our Government to agree on everything! I want the approval of the American People First!</p>",

What ever these countries Tarriff us on than we should Tarriff them on! Equally Trade and Stop this one sidedness. We need much better Deals because the U.S. Has got to STOP GETTING RIPPED OFF!</p>",
    "q4":"GET RID OF IT Completely! Replace this So Called Affordable care act opening State line Healthcare Borders. Insurance Companies should be fighting for our Business and when everyone can SHOP for Good Healthcare plans than we will get Plans that fit our Personal Family Needs. We need to regulate pharmaceuticals. Stop taxing Medical Equipment. This equipment saves our lives. Pricing should have some kind of Regulation or prices will get out of control. This is the Trade off. No taxes on the Equipment for Caping prices. Insurance companies should have regulations as well. We will create a Healthcare committee that will have power and not abusive power but power. Drawing up a beneficial plan that is good for Doctors, Patients and Healthcare providers. I want everyone to be happy with their choices of Doctors, Hospitals, providers, prices of their prescriptions, procedures and pre-Existing problems. Stop this giving free healthcare to the world because this will bankrupt America. There is more.</p>",
    "q5":"Anytime the Government gets involved with Wallstreet seems like nothing good comes from it. The Fairness should increase and the Greed must stop. Peoples life savings should be protected.

    "q1":"The agreement with Iran was an inexcusable failure of the members of Congress to stand in defense of the Constitution which they swear an oath to defend. The President has no constitutional authority to enter into agreements or deals with foreign nations. Per Article II, Section 2 of the Constitution the President may enter into Treaties provided 2/3 of the Senate concurs. Congressman Harris and others sat by and did nothing to protest the President's unconstitutional agreement to allow Iran, the leading exporter of world wide terrorism, to obtain nuclear weapons, and gave the mullahs $150 Billion dollars, which will be used to divide us from our allies and to foster terrorism. I find it disingenuous of Congressman Harris and others in Congress who failed to act when it was necessary but now decry the Iranian deal. It was Congressman Harris and others who failed to object and actually participated in the unconstitutional practice which allowed this agreement. The Iranian deal is one of the most dangerous agreements ever entered into by the United States and was a total abrogation of our responsibility as a world leader and protector of freedom and western philosophy. When I go to Congress I will do everything in my power to undo the agreement with Iran and to prevent them from ever obtaining a nuclear weapon.</p>",
    "q2":"We should follow the Constitution. Present the case for declaring war to the Congress. If Congress declares war, have our Joint Chiefs of Staff, propose a plan of attack, allow our military to fulfill its mission without political interference. Provide our military with everything they need to perform and to do so protecting the lives of our military to the utmost possibility. Support our veterans both on the battlefield and when returning. We also need to stop all immigration from countries that can not provide all the information on its citizens necessary to properly and fully investigate their backgrounds and terrorist ties. Keep open the Guantanamo Bay detention camp and use it to house and interrogate Islamic terrorists and others involved in acts of war against the United States. They are not civilians they are unconventional military opponents of the United States and are not entitled to be treated as mere criminals. We are at war whether we want to acknowledge that war or not. We need to act accordingly and to destroy the threats from ISIS and any other threats to the western ideals of liberty, freedom and democracy.</p>",
    "q3":"No I do not support the TPP. The TPP was created in secrecy. After the details became known, we learned why there was such an effort by the Obama administration to keep the TPP details secret. TPP will set common standards in areas including employment, food safety, the Internet, corporate governance and intellectual property. It also establishes new tribunals under which corporations can sue governments for laws that affect their profits. The TPP will benefit corporations at the expense of public health, the environment, free speech and labor rights. </p><p>Rep. Rosa DeLauro (D-CT), said that despite comments from President Obama that, \"No trade agreement is going to force us to change our laws,\" the bill to repeal Country Of Origin Labeling, (HR. 2393), shows that \"trade agreements have a direct effect on our sovereignty.\" Congressman Harris, voted for HR 2393, 2015, the Country of Origin Labeling Amendment Act of 2015 which prevents American farmers from being able to label their beef, pork or chicken as being from the United States. How does this possibly help American farmers or consumers? It does not benefit Americans to react to being threatened with tariffs by surrendering our sovereignty.</p><p>Free trade deals have not been good for the US in the past. Most recently, dangerous Mexican trucks were granted access to our roads threatening the safety of Americans daily. Current U.S. trade policies undermine our domestic regulations and allow other countries and corporate interests to run roughshod over our laws.</p>",
    "q4":"The one thing I would do to improve Obamacare is to repeal it. I offered a bill in the Maryland legislature to repeal the Maryland version of Obamacare. Congressman Harris voted to fully fund Obamacare in Congress. (Cromnibus bill 2014) Once, repealed I would offer insurance policies across state lines and allow people to purchase insurance in a menu like manner only purchasing what they need or want. I would work to increase incentives for investing in an (HSA) Health Savings Account.</p><p>The federal government needs to be out of the insurance business and leave the growth and development of methods and ideas to deal with making insurance available to everyone who wants it up to the States. The Affordable Care Act, more popularly known as Obama care has been a complete disaster as are most socialist ideas. Obamacare has proven to be more costly and less effective in providing health insurance coverage. It has also had a horrific stifling effect on the economy because businesses do not want to hire employees for whom they have to supply expensive insurance coverage. I prefer allowing capitalism, free markets and incentives as the way to promote increased medical insurance availability.</p>",
    "q5":"I do not believe the steps taken will prevent a much larger collapse but instead have only prolonged it. It was Congress that was the impetus behind mortgages being given to those who were not qualified to be able to pay for them. Yet, Congress blamed the mortgage industry for giving loans to those who did not have the financial ability to pay the loans. The current regulations will keep Wall Street appearing to be viable but the 20 Trillion Dollars in debt owed by the United States and the decreasing ability of Americans to improve their own economic situation will cause any recovery to be stretched out over decades. Banks are not loaning money because there is not interest to be earned. The Fed is not raising interest rates because the government will not be able to pay the interest on the 20 Trillion Dollars of debt the US has accumulated. Congress needs to refrain from interfering in the market place. Socialism and forcing socially motivated policies on the free market were as responsible for the collapse of our economic system as was any greed by Wall Street. As for more being done, those guilty of criminal activity which led to the collapse of financial institutions need to be criminally charged and prosecuted. When someone guilty of manipulating the markets for personal gain in an illegal manner is punished it will stop.</p>",
    "q6":"I would characterize President Obama's legacy as a Kakistocracy. </p><p>President Obama's greatest accomplishment, in his mind, would be his ability to bully and intimidate the Republican majority in the Congress into allowing him to operate outside the restraints placed upon him as the President. He would consider it a success that he was able to convince Congressman Andy Harris and the other Republican establishment members to vote to fully fund Obamacare, vote for expanded federally funded abortion, vote for amnesty for illegal immigrants and to vote to support the largest tax increase in history. (Cromnibus bill 2014)</p><p>His greatest failure is his operating outside the Constitutional restraints placed upon the office of President. Obama weakened America in the eyes of the world. Obama socialized and bankrupted our economy. He lied repeatedly about the policies he implemented through unconstitutional means. He allowed the various agencies of Government, including but not limited to the IRS, the Attorney General's Office, the NSA, to be used against the American people for political purposes. He turned his back on Americans who depended on him in Benghazi and they died, he turned his back on Veterans who needed his help and they died. He ordered the death of American citizens without trial. Obama's Presidency has been a shameful and hurtful time in American history and it will take decades to recover from the harm he has done to our nation and our pride. His administration is the definition of a Kakistocracy.</p>",
    "q7":"I do not support an increase in the federal minimum wage. The federal government has no Constitutional right to be involved in wage issues. The affect of raising the minimum wage is to hurt business growth and to cost jobs. The federal government should not require paid sick time because the federal government has no Constitutional authority to be involved in the issue of employee wages or sick leave. This is a State law issue and a private employment contract issue. If an employee has a contract or is a union member they can bargain for wages and leave terms.</p>",
    "q8":"Congress is specifically restricted from infringing upon the Second Amendment rights of citizens by the Bill of Rights. The steps it should take to reduce gun violence are to prohibit actions such as \"Fast and Furious\" which led to the federal government selling firearms to Mexican drug cartels which were eventually used to kill an American border agent. Congress should also pass laws that would punish criminals who use firearms in the commission of crimes across state lines, keeping those persons locked up to serve their full sentences would help reduce gun crime. </p><p>Congress should help reduce the stigma associated with mental health so more people would be willing to seek mental health services for themselves and their loved ones. Also more money should be made available to medicaid and medicare for doctors who see mental health patients so the homeless and those in jail would be more likely able to receive some mental health care. There should also be money made available for community mental health centers so persons with mental health problems can receive local mental health services. If congress were to pass any legislation regarding firearms it should only be a universal reciprocity bill that says anyone traveling through any State who has a permit to carry from another State would find their permit accepted by all other states. </p>",
    "q9":"Yes, an non political app or a non political entity should look at the natural boundaries, county lines etc and draw the congressional district lines. Maryland has gerrymandered the lines to assure white democrats represent what should be majority minority districts represented by democrats of color in congress by stretching the district lines out of Montgomery County and Prince George's County into the surrounding counties. Democratic leadership sells this as reducing the Republican representation in congress but it actually guarantees that areas that would otherwise be represented by Black Democrats are instead represented by White Democrats. I believe the districts should be done at the local level not the federal level.</p>",
    "q10":"I am fed up with being represented by those who put their party ahead of their principles and put politics ahead of the people they represent. Our county is in dire straits. Our debt is almost insurmountable, taxes are destroying the ability of business to prosper or grow causing a loss of jobs and stagnating the ability of the middle class to advance economically or to save. I am tired of electing people who say all the right things to get elected then do all the wrong things once in office. Congressman Harris is out of touch with the people of the 1st District and is too willing to compromise in DC. Congressman Harris claimed to oppose Obamacare but voted to fully fund it, Harris said he opposed illegal immigration but voted to fund the Obama amnesty, Harris said he opposes expanding federally funded abortion but voted to expand it, Harris says he is against new taxes but voted for the largest tax increase in history, all these were done under the Cromnibus bill, 2014. I have fought and voted against all these things in the legislature and will continue to do so in Congress. I want a smaller federal government that stays out of our daily lives. I want a government that stands with its back to me holding a shield not stands facing me holding a sword.</p>"

    "q1":"I'm adamantly opposed to the U.S./Iran deal. Iran has historically proved to the U.S. that it cannot be trusted. Nothing positive can be gained from this agreement on behalf of the U.S. Hopefully a Republican Presidential Candidate will win the upcoming election and repeal the agreement (deal). I support any international agreement to cease Iran's nuclear capabilities.</p>",
    "q2":"I'm a former U.S. Marine. I'm opposed to sending our troops to war UNLESS it's absolutely required to protect the security interests of America and not a political agenda. We (U.S. & Allies) need to deploy to Syria and eliminate ISIS. Furthermore, the U.S. should NOT allow any Syrian refugees into the U.S. The U.S. government will not be able to thoroughly vet any of the refugees. Eliminate ISIS in Syria and the refugees can return to their homeland.</p>",
    "q3":"I support \"Free Trade.\" The U.S. needs to be mindful of \"currency manipulation\" & \"dumping\" by other countries (i.e. China). Countervailing duties (tariffs) by the U.S. is not enough. The U.S. should cease importing goods from countries that have been identified as violators (dumping). Furthermore, the U.S. needs to support U.S. corporations (fair corporate tax) and make it profitable for them to remain in the U.S. It allows for the U.S. government to draw from a dependable tax base and it employs workers. Those corporations that choose to move their businesses overseas will not be allowed to import their product back to the U.S. or the tariffs imposed will make it nonprofitable.</p>",
    "q4":"Repeal it. Obamacare destroys small businesses. The healthcare act is non-sustainable. Co-Ops are failing. Illegal Immigrants are receiving benefits that they are not entitled to.</p>",
    "q5":"We need less government regulation. I would like to see a \"Fair Flat Tax\" for businesses (reduce corporate tax). Eliminate Dodd-Frank Act (hurts small banks that typically loan to small businesses). Eliminate government subsidies in various industries to reduce government regulation and allow businesses to grow or fail without government intervention.</p>",
    "q6":"He created Obamacare (Affordable Care Act) which is unsustainable and detrimental to small businesses. He has increased the division between races. He has jeopardized the safety of the country by supporting Syrian refugees to come to the U.S., releasing Guantanamo Bay prisoners back onto the battlefield and failing to address the continued wave of illegal immigration flowing into the U.S. from Mexico. Disrespectful to the U.S. military veterans by not revamping the VA and doesn't support law enforcement.</p>",
    "q7":"I support a federal minimum wage of $10.00. I support paid sick leave and family leave, but I do not feel the federal government should regulate this on private/small businesses.</p>",
    "q8":"I support the 2nd amendment. STOP government regulations / restrictions (gun control). We need to have a nationwide Open Carry or Concealed Weapon policy for ALL legal gun owners. There should be NO restrictions as to what types of firearms our citizens can own. Allow for our citizens that pass the instant background check the ability to exercise their 2nd Amendment Right and protect themselves.</p>",
    "q9":"I support reforming the congressional district lines. District 1 comprises of 12 counties, where others consist of significantly smaller coverage area. This should be decided at a State level. States Rights - Less Federal Regulation (intrusion)</p>",
    "q10":"Dissatisfied with current incumbent. Concerned for the well-being of our Country. Tired of being let down by untruthful politicians. Provide integrity and accountability for the constituents of District 1.</p>"

    "q1":"I supported this bipartisan agreement after intense study and negotiation with the White House. While the JCPOA remains imperfect, it is the best opportunity we have to reduce Iran's nuclear threat and its ability to export terrorism. It removes the greatest weapon from one of our most dangerous adversaries and helps protect our ally, Israel.</p><p>Without the JCPOA, time was not on our side. Iran was only two to three months away from having enough fissile material to build a nuclear weapon. Pushing Iran back to negotiations was not only unfeasible, but dangerous. The U.S. no longer had the support of our allies to keep international sanctions in place. The JCPOA stopped Iran's progress dead in its tracks, and crippled its ability to build a nuclear weapon for at least 10 years.</p><p>In addition to international sanctions, the United States can still enforce domestic sanctions on Iran's non-nuclear activities and can still create new sanctions on the Iranian regime if needed. For example, I am cosponsoring legislation to enforce new sanctions against Iran because they violated U.N. Security Council resolutions pertaining to ballistic missile testing.</p><p>I secured explicit assurance from the White House that the military option will be considered if Iran advances toward a nuclear weapon at any point during the deal's lifetime. As an Appropriator, I also helped secured a commitment for greater military aid to Israel, including a robust Foreign Military Financing package, continued access to the U.S. arsenal and increased missile defense funding.</p>",
    "q2":"ISIS is a unique threat to our country because these terrorists are not only barbaric, they are very well-organized and very well-funded. Battling ISIS in Syria has been very different than dealing with them in Iraq because Syria has sophisticated air defense systems. As Ranking Member of the House Intelligence Committee, I received regular briefings on the threat and traveled to Syria. Those briefings strengthened my resolve to destroy ISIS.</p><p>We must continue our successful air strikes in coordination with our allies. We must continue using U.S. Special Operations to take the fight to ISIS. But we cannot be the sheriff of the world; we must engage other countries in dealing with ISIS. I recently traveled to Russia and met with high-ranking officials to ensure that we fight our common threat: ISIS. We also need our Arab allies to take a larger role and commit significant troops to defeat these terrorists.</p><p>At home, we need American Muslim leaders to stand up and denounce ISIS. We must also counter ISIS' recruiting efforts on social media and bring jihadists in our country to justice.</p><p>In the long-term, we need to join with the international community in pursing cease-fires and a political resolution to the Syrian civil war.</p>",
    "q3":"I have opposed the most recent free trade agreements considered by Congress because I believe they hurt the U.S. labor market and provide few benefits to the businesses in my district. We must recognize that we live in a global economy, but our first priority must be American jobs. I therefore cannot support the TPP agreement at this time.</p><p>In addition, I oppose the so-called \"Fast Track\" process, which would allow the administration to negotiate trade deals without Congressional oversight. Fast Track ignores our Constitutional system of checks and balances, enabling Congress to only vote \"yes\" or \"no\" on trade deals without the ability to amend or improve them.</p>",
    "q4":"During ACA negotiations, I lobbied my colleagues to include an exemption for small businesses who might not have the means to provide healthcare benefits to employees. Thanks in part to my efforts, the final bill included an exemption for companies that employ 25 or fewer workers. I would have like to see this threshold increased to 50 employees to exempt even more small businesses and provide greater flexibility. </p><p>The ACA got the camel's nose in the tent and has produced positive results for many – seniors especially. The bill has helped reduce the cost of prescription drugs for seniors and guaranteed they can be insured even if they have pre-existing conditions, for example. </P><p>This is why I would like to see the bill improved rather than repealed. Unfortunately, the House of Representatives has voted more than 60 times to repeal the bill, and not once to improve it.</p>",
    "q5":"Yes, they were appropriate and, yes, more needs to be done. Wall Street collapsed because of irresponsible decisions that devastated everyday Americans. People lost their jobs, their homes and their retirement savings. Yet, while middle class wages stagnate, executive compensation and bonuses continue to soar to unprecedented levels. Someone needs to be held accountable and we need to guarantee to my constituents – and my country – that this never happens again. We need to remove excessive risk-taking and restore accountability in the financial system.</p>",
    "q6":"The President's greatest success – and what will be his legacy – is engaging young people and making politics more accessible to Americans who previously felt left out. More than 12 million young Americans elected Barack Obama in a history-defying voter turn-out. He is the first president to effectively use social media to communicate with the electorate and directly promoted the increased use of social media among government agencies. He produces Vine videos, is on Pinterest and live-streamed this year's State of the Union. He has forever changed the way the President speaks to America.</p><p>One of the President's biggest failure has been his inability, or perhaps unwillingness, to work with Congress to get things accomplished. The President relied heavily on Democratic leadership to lobby lawmakers on his policy positions rather than building relationships and working directly with Members of Congress on common sense compromises. As a result, the partisan bickering that he pledged to end has only worsened.</p><p>I would be remiss if I did not mention Syria as one of the President's greatest failures. President Obama drew a \"red line\" on chemical weapons in Syria. Yet, when Assad used sarin gas on his own people, we did not act. This irreparably damaged our credibility with our allies and set us up for the situation we find ourselves in today.</p>",
    "q7":"Yes, in fact, I am cosponsoring legislation to gradually raise the federal minimum wage from $7.25 to $12 by 2020. It would also index the minimum wage to keep pace with the country's rising median wage. In Maryland, more than 600,000 workers – including 93,000 working mothers – stand to benefit from this bill.</p><p>No one who works full time should live in poverty. Currently, a full-time minimum wage worker earns about $15,000 a year - or 19 percent below the poverty line for a family of three. Since the minimum wage reached $7.25 six years ago in 2009, the minimum wage has not kept pace with inflation or the growth in the median wage, resulting in low-wage workers continuing to fall behind. In fact, the real value of today's minimum wage is less than it was in 1956.</p><p>Economists agree that, if done right, raising the federal minimum wage could be good for business. Today, the top 1 percent of the population owns 35 percent of the country's wealth. If we evened out this disparity, the paychecks of the lower-wage earners would get pumped right back into the economy and other local businesses. Consumer demand goes up, there is greater productivity and less turnover, offsetting the higher labor costs associated with raising the minimum wage for employers.</p><p>I support required paid sick leave among government agencies and contractors and think we should explore tax incentives that would enable all small businesses to provide it as well.</p>",
    "q8":"I strongly believe in the Second Amendment, but we also have a Constitutional responsibility to protect American citizens from harm. I support efforts to ban true assault weapons and high-capacity magazines, which have been the weapons of choice for mass shooters because their sole purpose is to inflict as much damage as possible as quickly as possible. When assault weapons or high-capacity magazines have been used in a shooting, the number of casualties has increased 63 percent. So while a ban may not stop these attacks, it will help drastically reduce the bloodshed.</p><p>I also support requiring background checks for all gun sales, including those purchased online and at gun shows and addressing the sale of firearms to the mentally ill.</p>",
    "q9":"Redistricting should be handled at the national level because a state-by-state approach could be used to disadvantage one party over the other. I believe a set of national, nonpartisan rules would result in moderate districts that are more representative of the American people, with pragmatic lawmakers that will work toward what's best for the country rather than what's best for their party.</p>",
    "q10":"I am running for office for the same reason I got into politics in the first place: to help people. My office has helped hundreds of families avoid foreclosure. We've helped veterans access the benefits they have earned. We've helped seniors navigate the Social Security and Medicare systems. I want to continue providing the best level of constituent service available in the country to the citizens of the Second District.</p><p>I am also asking voters to allow me to continue creating jobs for the middle class and bringing federal funds back to the district. As a Member of the House Appropriations Committee, I am in a position to ensure Maryland's Second District gets its share of the federal pie. This role will become even more critical as I become the last Democrat in the Maryland delegation on the committee.</p><p>I also believe Congress needs more moderate voices, rather than ideologues and obstructionists who will put their party over their country. I have built strong relationships with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle and I continue to believe that we can learn from one another and work together to make our country great again. Compromise is hard work – it means rolling up your sleeves, listening to one another and negotiating in good faith. This is something I have practiced in my personal life, in business and in politics.</p>"

    "q2":"ISIS needs to be monitored and controlled. I do not support a direct war or aggression against ISIS, however, I do support the protection of civilian lives and the restoration of order to independent governments. I believe the best way to combat ISIS and diminish their effects is to control their access to digital media and their ability to propagate their message and to reduce their financial capacity through the seizure of assets and elimination of income producing assets as well as elimination of munitions supplies. I believe that if you stop directly fighting them and focus on cutting off resources, they will eventually decline due to financial issues (this can already be seen as they announced a decrease in salaries for their soldiers).</p>",
    "q3":"I support free trade, which includes the TPP although I do not support all of the provisions of the TPP. Free trade is good if it is properly monitored and if all participants are treated equally and none of the participants are allowed to peg their currencies to force a long term trade imbalance. China has been allowed to peg their currency and leverage that to maintain a very unbalanced trade surplus (for them) and trade deficit for the United States. I would include provisions to prevent currency pegging and/or other practices that create large imbalances.</p>",

You have no idea what the price is for the service until you get billed for the service. It's time to require all prices to be published.</p><p>I want to create legislation requiring that all healthcare service prices be published and available to all consumers. This includes creating estimates for procedures such as surgery. This will allow consumers to be informed and to make informed decisions, which in turn will lead to lower prices.</p><p>Healthcare is the only industry where the consumer has no idea what the costs are until they eventually receive a bill. These bills are often a shock. It's time to stop this and make the costs transparent and available to everyone.</p><p>If there is only one thing I accomplish, this is it.</p>",
    "q5":"Financial regulations will require continuous adjustments to make improvements and to account for changes in the financial environment. I do not believe that current regulations will create an environment where we are able to avoid a financial crisis, only to minimize the chances of a reoccurrence of a particular root cause of a crisis. Many of the regulations do not adequately address the risks and there are too many loopholes that allow the financial industry to take on the same risks, but just call it something different. On the other hand these regulations are written too complicated and no consideration was given to the cost of implementation and their effects on smaller financial institutions, which impacts competition and places more of the risks with the larger financial institutions, who are more likely to take higher risks that could create another financial crisis. </p><p>Speaking of financial crisis, there is one brewing now, which is the highly leveraged oil exploration - primarily the Fracking industry. With lower oil prices, they are unable to pay back loans, which means high levels of default. The government is in no position to deal with this (ie. not prepared). It seems that the government is too reactionary and does not look at leading indicators or evaluate overall risks to protect the economy. The US needs some risk management instead of regulations.</p>",
    "q6":"I do not really follow a president or consider their legacy (accomplishments and failures). These are really accomplishments and failures of the overall government. </p><p>Areas I think Obama did good at: </p><p>- Starting conversations on particular topics and turning them into discussions and debates in order to acknowledge and identify problems.</p><p>- Using information from these discussions to implement some policies and/or legislation to try and address the issues.</p><p>Areas where I think he could have done better:</p><p>- Foreign policy could have been better formulated.</p><p>- Listening, he could have listened to the people and Congress and had healthy discussions with Congress to develop the best solutions.</p><p>- It seems he (or rather the government in general) supported a division in politics and relying a lot on the extremes which caused government shutdowns and very reactionary policies (TARP, etc.)</p>",
    "q7":"I support adjustments to the minimum wage. I do not believe the government should require paid sick time or family leave above what is currently legislated.</p><p>How minimum wages would be set/adjusted:</p><p>a. Base minimum (set by the federal government and adjusted annually for inflation/deflation)</p><p>b. Location (set by the locality city/state)</p><p>- Adjustments to base minimum would be based off of inflation</p><p>- Location would adjust based on your location and cost of living in the area</p><p>The government uses a pay system similar to this in that it includes the base salary as well as location.</p><p>In this model all wages have the base component adjusted for inflation and everyone receives the same $ change based on inflation or deflation and everyone has the possibility of adjustments to cover differences based on where they live. </p>",
    "q8":"I want to implement a simple plan of licensing in order to purchase guns.</p><p>I will preface this with: I own guns, I have owned guns for many years, I have been a member of the NRA.</p><p>I will propose legislation to create a firearms licensing program. Under this program US Citizens may apply for a firearms license. </p><p> A full background check would be completed on the applicant</p><p> Applicant will be required to provide proof of training/qualification for firearms safety</p><p> If you are disqualified as a licensee (for reasons such as a felony, etc.) then your license must be returned</p><p> failure to return the license will result in mandatory penalties.</p><p> The license would be tied to a database, so gun dealers, etc. could do a quick lookup to see if the license was still valid.</p><p> The license holder could purchase any gun at any time in any state in any quantity with no waiting period.</p><p> The license holder would have carry permission in all states (including concealed carry if they added that onto the license)</p><p> When you go to buy a firearm, you present your license, the dealer looks up your license number to verify you are still certified and if so, you buy the gun that day</p><p> This would not track firearms you purchased, only authorizing you to do so</p>",

To combat this evil, we must actually strengthen our military and intelligence community, allow them to do their jobs, and we must be smart about how we do these things. We must rebuild American confidence of in our law enforcement, and reintroduce our nation to community accountability and a citizen government. We must feel confident that our government is working for the safety and futherence of the American people.

    "q4":"Narrowing the list of improvements needed by Obamacare to one is unreasonable. Rather one thing I would keep from the law before replacing it would be the much needed regulation that people shall not be denied coverage for preexisting conditions. Obamacare itself was a huge overreach by the federal government, and in typical government fashion it complicated an already complex and broken healthcare system. What we should do is scrap most of this unworkable bill and replace it with a free market system that encourages competition and actually provides Americans with cost effective options rather than a penalty.</p>",
    "q5":"The complexity of the Dodd-Frank Act, in its more than 2,300 pages of text is astounding and proving unworkable for middle America. Rather than reign in Wall Street and banks that are \"too big to fail,\" the Act has increased the probability of future bailouts. Home town banks have felt the brunt of the Act, which in turn limits small business growth. I do not believe this is a question of doing more but rather a question of passing smarter and less complicated legislation that does not require implementation before its true faults can be seen.</p>",
    "q6":"Divisive. President Obama sold a great deal of hope and transparency, but delivered sharp rehetoric and unaccountability. As he nears the end of his presidency, his goal seems to be centered on adding as much as he can to his Presidential resume, regardless of how unconstitutional his actions may be. Rather than listen to the people, who have spoken through their elected representatives, President Obama continues to bypass Congress in his stubborn attempts to push his own ideas on this Nation. Rather than work within the Constitutional framework of this great Nation, he has pushed through a failing and convoluted healthcare law, a weak compromise with Iran, and a makeshift and unconstitutional immigration plan. </p><p>However, the question included President Obama's failures and accomplishments, so in all fairness he did an incredible job of engaging young Americans in the political process. Now it is up to us to make sure that the next generation is equally engaged and prepared to defend our Constitution.</p>",
    "q7":"There are over 28 million small businesses in America, and those small businesses account for 54% of our sales and 55% of all jobs. However since the 1980's, the rate at which new business have started has decreased by 28% due largely to federal regulations. This overregulation is making it harder for ordinary Americans to start and maintain their own businesses. The myth that raising the minimum wage will raise living standards is an empty promise.</p><p>I support minimizing government intrusion and instead facilitating an environment where employers can hire, retain and fairly compensate their employees. Americans deserve good paying jobs and the opportunity to properly provide for their families. As the mother of a toddler, I understand the need for paid sick time and family leave. I am often reminded of how fortunate I was to have an employer that recognized my family's needs and offered 3 months of paid maternity leave. However, I also recognize that my employer was in the position to offer this benefit. Many small family owned business are struggling to stay afloat, and increased federal requirements would either sabotage them or the cost would be passed on to the consumers thereby undermining the wage increase. Therefore the focus should be on incentivising employers to provide these necessary benefits through tax benefits rather than piling on more government regulation to an already struggling economy.</p>",
    "q8":"As a strong defender of the Second Amendment and our Constitution as a whole, I believe we must figure out a way to maintain the integrity and heart of the Second Amendment while also ensuring the safety of the American public by enforcing tailored, common sense laws and strengthening public education on mental health. We must remember that the Second Amendment is not a temporary privilege like a drivers' license but a vital Constitutional right. Furthermore, to truly overcome gun violence we must be honest about the role of criminals as opposed to law abiding citizens. Mass shootings are becoming horrifyingly common. Unfortunately the current path of demonizing \"the other side,\" and knee jerk reactions, will lead only to division and failure while the American public is left in fear. How, instead do we jealously guard the line between our constitutional rights and individual security? How can we ensure that children and teachers know that they are safe and can focus on the business of education? This is a complex, multifaceted problem, and it would be foolish to expect an immediate answer. However I understand that to make America safer and maintain the integrity of the 2nd Amendment, we must have open dialogue; we must put American values ahead of egos and partisan marketing, and we must use facts and common sense instead of rhetoric.</p>",
    "q9":"Absolutely yes, the process by which Maryland congressional district lines are drawn must be reformed. Congressional districts were intended to adequately represent the views of their residents at the national level in Congress. However, in Maryland, democrats (and Republicans in other states) have instead gerrymandered irrational lines in successful efforts to cherry pick their own favorable voters. This has lead to the disenfranchisement of scores of voters in Maryland and across America. I am fully in favor of Governor Larry Hogan's proposal of a fair, transparent and nonpartisan commission to replace the current governor-led commission on redistricting. We must protect the right of Americans to chose our leaders and remove from office those that fail us. However I firmly believe that this is an issue that should be handled at the state level. Our Consitution does not grant the power of redistricting to the federal government and thus that power rests with the states.</p>",
    "q10":"I am a 31 year old wife, mother and attorney. My father is from Mexico, and my mother fled the civil war in El Salvador in the early 1980's. They settled in East Texas where I was born, and from their experiences, they made sure that I never took for granted all the incredible rights that we have in America. I grew up surrounded by conservative values, and the belief we should expect more from ourselves than anyone else. So when I see our laws being ignored and our Constitution being degraded by our own government, I must act. I was not raised to stand by and wait for someone else to do the hard work that needs to be done. Furthermore, when I think about the day my own daughter has to go into the world and make her own way, the idea that she may not have every right and freedom as every American before her is unacceptable. I will not let that happen when I know that she and every American deserves a government that is truly of the people, by the people and for the people.</p>"

Many doctors have stopped accepting Medicaid patients due to low payments for services. I would push to provide subsidies for the poor and working poor to be able to afford private insurance. My wife delivered a \"still born\" baby boy in 2014. The doctor that cared for her during/after the pregnancy and knew her history stopped accepting her insurance.

The Lincoln Amendment should be added back to the Dodd Frank financial regulation law and more regulation is needed to refocus banks more on lending and not speculating which would lead us back to another financial crisis.</p>",

The Iran Nuclear Agreement and his work on climate change are also great accomplishments.</p><p>President Obama's greatest failure was his inability to reduce wars around the world which was a stated goal. The world is on fire and if effective diplomacy is not utilized we may be on the brink of another major war.</p>",
    "q7":"I support an increase of the minimum wage to $15 by 2020. The current minimum wage is outdated and too low for this day and time. The United States is the only industrialized Nations without paid sick time or family leave; this workplace policy is out of synch with the changing realties of modern families, and with changing roles of men and woman both at home and work.</p>",
    "q8":"I believe that people without being provoked would not resort to gun violence. Congress should put greater emphasis on identifying and treating the mentally ill before they become a danger to the public. Congress should also enact stricter laws against gun trafficking especially focusing on \"straw purchasers\" who have continuously transferred guns to prohibited owners. Finally, Congress should expand background checks for gun purchasers. Currently, the private sales \"loophole\" exempts an estimated 45 percent of gun purchasers from background checks, which are meant to ensure criminals and the mentally ill do not acquire guns.</p>",
    "q9":"The process by which congressional district lines are drawn have been overdue for reform because of the conflict of interest involved. Legislators have the ability to draw their own district boundaries, dividing neighborhoods or groups of people in ways that benefit their own electoral needs. I support the creation of Nonpartisan Independent Redistricting Commissions to replace the current Congressional redistricting process. The majority of the commission should be composed of members not affiliated with either major political party.</p>",

Together we can remove the career politicians who represent billionaires that continue to manipulate them. These same career politicians have begun screaming for change in campaign finance only to win an election. There is also a need to set term limits on Congress to infuse new ideas and change the status quo which will move our country forward. The American people have been complaining for years about the \"do nothing Congress\", now is the time for action to remove the political establishment.</p>"

    "q1":"I supported the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) because I believe it will be effective in pulling Iran back from the threshold of becoming a nuclear weapon state and in keeping Iran away from that threshold for at least ten to twelve years. Thereafter, the detection regime that will remain in place, along with other U.S. and allied intelligence capabilities, should allow the United States to discover any attempt by Iran to breakout to a nuclear weapon and to make that discovery in time to thwart such an attempt. By contrast, walking away from the Agreement could leave the United States less informed regarding Iran's ambitions and less capable of mounting an effective response.My decision to support the JCPOA relies heavily on the fact that nothing in the Agreement in any way constrains the United States on Day 1 and in perpetuity from taking a full range of actions against Iran – economic, diplomatic and military – if it believes Iran is seeking to develop a nuclear weapon. At root, the Agreement is a test – a test of Iran's readiness to pursue a different path. If Iran fails that test at any point along the way, I believe the United States will be well-equipped to act, and in taking whatever steps are necessary to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon, will have the strong support of its international partners.</p>",
    "q2":"I believe the threat from the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant is real and that the United States and the international community have a deep stake in addressing it. I recognize that humanitarian and international security issues necessitate efforts to combat this terrorist group's advance and ultimately to degrade and destroy it. That's why I support a strategy that would build a broad and diverse coalition of international partners to protect the US and its allies and meet the ISIL threat. While the US military can be used to stem the tide of violence, it is up to Iraqis and their Arab partners to create and ensure a long-term strategy for a safe and secure region.</p>",
    "q3":"Our trade policies have long assumed that \"free trade\" is the same as \"fair trade.\" I opposed Fast Track Authority for the TPP because I had serious concerns about both the process by which the agreement was developed as well as about its content. Negotiations for the TPP deal were conducted largely behind closed doors, with multinational corporations and other global conglomerates being disproportionately represented at the negotiating table. In addition, many portions of the proposed agreement were only shared on a classified and selective basis. All trade agreements – particularly ones of this size and scope – should be vetted with as much transparency as possible to ensure that the American public's interests are being protected. Finally, I was concerned that protections and enforcement mechanisms necessary to preserve workplace safety, protect the environment and promote human rights were not as robust as they could be. I worry that despite optimistic predictions about how the deal will lead to greater exports for American businesses, the actual effect will be to make overseas manufacturers the winners and unleash a flood of foreign goods into our economy, resulting in the loss of American jobs. I believe we must reset our nation's trade policies to ensure that fairness and American values guide U.S. trade agreements so that we can level the playing field for American businesses. I place a very high priority on preserving high-wage jobs, and on increasing the competitiveness of our companies domestically and abroad.</p>",
    "q4":"I support the Affordable Care Act because I believe it's a crucial step in our effort to reduce the cost of health care for families and small businesses, as well as to provide access for those who currently do not have insurance. The ACA is already providing lower costs and better health coverage for millions of Americans, including individuals who have received free preventive services, such as check-ups and cancer screenings; seniors in the \"donut hole\" who have saved billions of dollars on their prescription drugs; and small business owners who have used the Small Business Health Care Tax Credit to help them afford health insurance for employees. One of my top health care priorities is to address workforce shortages, particularly those for primary care physicians, who are a critical part of reorienting our healthcare system towards one that focuses on prevention and keeping people healthy, rather than one that only treats the sick. While we included several provisions in the ACA to alleviate some of these shortages more needs to be done. That's why I introduced H.R. 5498, the Primary Care Physician Reentry Act, which will help combat America's shortage of primary care physicians by encouraging mid-career and retired or retiring physicians to return to practice. This legislation would provide training and financial assistance to physicians returning to medical practice in exchange for their service at community health centers, Veterans Administration medical centers or school-based health centers.</p>",
    "q5":"It is no secret: past policies of lax regulation and oversight led to an \"anything goes\" culture within the financial services industry. That is why I supported the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform bill in 2010, which has begun to put an end to the risky practices that crashed the housing market and started the Great Recession. Still, more can be done and I will continue to fight in Congress for sensible reforms to our nation's financial market, such as improving access to sound retirement advice, strengthening the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, and bringing strong oversight and regulation to the corners of the so-called \"shadow banking system.\"   </p>",
    "q6":"I believe that President Obama's legacy will be his efforts to guide our country through an economic crisis here at home as well as international turmoil with a steady, thoughtful hand. His greatest legislative accomplishments have been improving the health of the American people, through both the passage of the Affordable Care Act and his strong record on the environment. The ACA is improving access, affordability and quality of health care, resulting in the largest reduction of the uninsured in four decades. On the environment, the Obama Administration is working to address climate change by reducing air pollution and emissions, strengthening environmental protections and increasing our commitment to clean water. </p>",
    "q7":"I am an original cosponsor of H.R. 2150, the Raise the Wage Act. This bill would increase the minimum wage to $12 per hour. I support this legislation because I believe a fair wage is an important part of assisting many working parents who are struggling to support their families. Raising the minimum wage is a first step for many families and individuals to achieve self-sufficiency - to say nothing of the difficulty these families have in maintaining certain basic requirements such as health care, money for their children's education, or retirement savings. Paid leave – both sick leave and family leave – are important benefits that are vital to the morale of our workforce, the health of our economy, and the strength of our country. That is why I have cosponsored legislation that would set a national standard for paid sick days and I am also a strong supporter of paid family leave. </p>",
    "q8":"We have witnessed too many mass shootings and deaths as a result of gun violence and it is time to pass laws that protect innocent lives while safeguarding the rights of lawful gun owners. For too long, the NRA and gun manufacturers have deployed political contributions and high-powered lobbyists to defeat commonsense policies that could reduce gun violence in our communities – violence that kills more than thirty Americans every single day. The public overwhelmingly supports gun safety reforms. It is up to Congress to put public safety first, not the interests and profits of the gun lobby. That's why I have consistently supported gun control legislation that would close additional loopholes in our background check system, including the so-called gun show loophole; we should limit the availability of high-capacity magazines; and we must prevent high-powered, military-grade firearms from getting into the hands of those who wish us harm – including criminals, domestic abusers, the dangerously mentally ill and individuals listed on the terrorist watch list. I have cosponsored multiple bills that would accomplish some of these goals, including the Public Safety and Second Amendment Rights Protection Act of 2015 (H.R. 1217), which would ensure that all individuals who should be prohibited from buying a firearm are listed in the National Instant Criminal Background Check System, the Gun Show Loophole Closing Act (H.R. 2380), and the Large Capacity Ammunition Feeding Device Act (H.R. 752) which would prohibit the transfer or possession of large capacity ammunition feeding devices. </p>",
    "q9":"I support creating national, independent and objective standards for drawing congressional districts. That's why I have worked with my colleagues in Congress to develop and introduce the Redistricting Reform Act of 2015, a comprehensive proposal that would establish independent redistricting commissions in every state.</p>",
    "q10":"I am proud to have made constituent service my number one priority. Traveling home to my district every evening allows me to do my job much better because I am in daily contact with the people I serve in Congress. I believe that being a good listener helps to guide my legislative efforts in Washington and has made me a better Congressman. That is the kind of representation I hope to continue to provide to the people of the Third District. One of my top legislative priorities in Congress is to end the reign of big money in our political system that has corroded our institutions of democracy. It's time to put government back in the hands of the public. That means promoting citizen-owned, grassroots funded, people driven campaigns. In an effort to fight back, I have introduced the Government Bythe People Act (H.R. 20). This legislation empowers grassroots supporters, includes a tax credit for campaign contributions and extra support to help candidates be heard when they are up against Super PACs and special interests. If enacted, this reform proposal would return our democracy to the people by amplifying the voices of everyday Americans.</p>"

    "q1":"I will support a second look at Iranian sanctions and other options for containing Iranian support of terrorism, as well as the expansion of their nuclear program. In the rush to sign an agreement, sanctions were lifted from known supporters of terrorism who had nothing to do with the nuclear program. Some of these same actors were responsible for funding and equipping forces in Iraq that killed or maimed hundreds of Americans. Iran has subsequently expanded its influence in Iraq, Yemen and Syria. I will listen to the concerns of the voters in the 3rd District and support measures to make Iranian expansionism more difficult. Due in part to the excesses of this agreement, America has lost the initiative in the Middle East. President Obama agreed to the Iran Nuclear Deal that the majority of Americans opposed by a 2-to-1 margin. I will support policies that are supported by the majority of Americans, that clarify our positions for those that support and oppose us, and provide rules of engagement that will accomplish our goals. I support a strong military presence in the region to counter the narrative that America is abandoning our allies in the Middle East.</p>",
    "q2":"As a Navy/Marine Corps veteran who has deployed twice to Iraq as the Commander of a Shock Trauma Platoon, I have experienced the human cost of war. A strong defense comes from a well-equipped and well-maintained military with a reasonable and firm foreign policy that puts the security of the homeland as its first priority. Generally while addressing international disputes with ISIS, diplomatic and economic measures should be exhausted first. However, I am resolute in my belief that if armed conflict is necessary for the security of American liberty and our way of life then the armed forces, and those of our allies should have the resources, direction, and rules of engagement required to bring the fight to the enemy and win as swiftly as possible – in their homeland, and not in ours.</p>",
    "q3":"I support policies that balance the protection of US industries with the global free trade that is the backbone of our economy. I recognize that there are times that government must intervene with other nations who have tilted the playing field to give an advantage to their home industries. Government intervention must be with a light hand, not picking industries that have government connections. We must work hard to eliminate \"crony capitalism.\"</p><p>In general, I support free trade that encourages a level playing field internationally and allows foreign markets access to US products and US consumers access to foreign products. However, when governments get involved in the nation's industry, they distort the normals rules of free trade. That's when our government must intervene on behalf of our industries. It is in our interest to open Pacific markets to US products in preference to the Chinese products. I am not for trade rules that would adversely affect specific industries native to the 3rd District of Maryland. This is when it is important to listen to the voters in the District. As their representative, I will hear their concerns before concluding a position based solely on the party position.</p>",
    "q4":"As a doctor myself, I know improving the Affordable Care Act is one of the cornerstones of regulatory relief, which will empower small business growth, decrease insurance costs, lower deductibles, all while maintaining universal coverage.</p><p></p><p>Many Americans are experiencing sharp increases in both health insurance premiums and deductibles – to the point that many have expensive insurance that covers very little of their actual health care costs. It has been reported that 60% of households do not have the cash on hand to cover their deductibles should they become ill. I would support policies that opened the sale of health insurance market across state lines. This would enlarge risk pools and lower costs. Further, I would support replacing the penalties and mandates of government-approved insurance with a refundable tax credit for the purchase of private insurance by all Americans. Lower income patients would no longer have the obstacle of having an insurance fewer and fewer doctors are taking. Older patients would be able to get policies that are tailored to their needs. And veterans would be given an alternative to the bureaucracies of the VA system. And to maintain universal coverage, I would support insurance subsidies for patients with high-risk, high-cost conditions. Real liability reform, along with a transition to paying for value will have the effect of lowering costs by putting the power and responsibility in the hands of those most closely affected, the patient and their doctor.</p>",
    "q5":"As a businessman myself, I know the heart of the American economic engine is small businesses, particularly new business start-ups. It's true that the rich are getting richer and the poor getting poorer, but this is due in part to the lack of new business startups that are one of the main drivers of employment. It is paradoxical that too often, the federal government's well-meaning but clumsy regulations that are intended to rein in the excesses of big businesses end up placing unsustainable burdens on small business. Dodd-Frank is a good example. In an effort to punish the excesses of big banks, a regulatory scheme was put in placed that is actually driving out small community banks and credit unions constrained by regulations that actually favor big banks. This, in turn, makes it harder for small businesses and startups to obtain credit from local lenders. The government needs to reform and streamline regulations and the tax code so that the innovative, entrepreneurial potential of the American people can flourish. I believe the corporate tax rate must be reduced if America is to remain the world's largest, most vibrant economy.</p>",
    "q6":"There can be no doubt that the greatest accomplishment of Barack Obama was the destruction of the glass ceiling for African Americans. History will record that these eight years stand as a reminder that the most powerful seat in the land can be occupied peacefully by any man of character and talent. However, this was also his greatest failure. He had the potential to become the American Nelson Mandela. A historic figure who would heal the centuries of the racial divide, showing the entire world that Americans are finally starting to realize the dream of Martin Luther King and the nation's founders that we are all truly equal. Unfortunately, I feel he was not up to the task. It appeared that he neither understood the obstacles or championed the successes encountered by his fellow Americans of both races. He will leave us more divided and less understood than we have been in a long time.</p>",
    "q7":"I support a free market that allows room for the least skilled workers to enter the market, learn the basics of work and responsibility, and move upward into higher skilled and higher paying positions. Government intervention in this natural process is, again, well-intended, but fraught with unintended consequences. High minimum wages feel fair, but they create a barrier to the entry of young and low-skilled worker just entering the market. Government intervention into the negotiations between labor and management hem in the options of both sides. Required sick time and family leave mandate lower wages and hurt those who don't avail themselves of the benefits. I support freedom of negotiation between labor and management that will reward the best of both with a steady and increased stream of high paying jobs with upward mobility.</p>",
    "q8":"I would support the actions of family and medical providers to remove the access to all means of violence, of those deemed to be a potential danger to themselves and others. However, I am a firm supporter of the 2nd Amendment, a gun owner, and two-time Iraq War Veteran. Just as the President and members of Congress are afforded the right to protection by those armed with a variety of weapons, the average American should likewise be afforded the same.</p>",
    "q9":"As residents of the most gerrymandered, the most contorted and scattered district in the nation, Maryland's Third District, we feel more alienated from our government today than perhaps any other time in our history. This practice of carving up of the electorate so that certain politicians can choose the voters who favor them and disadvantage those who don't is an embarrassment for Maryland and counter to the principles on which America was built. The Constitution places the responsibility for drawing lines for fair representation squarely on the shoulders of state legislators. Further, the Supreme Court has upheld cases that supported nonpartisan state redistricting commissions. As such, I fully support Governor Hogan's Redistricting Commission, and I will fight to let Maryland's Congressional districts represent the people living there — not the political will of party bosses.</p>",
    "q10":"When I volunteered to go to Iraq with the Marines at the tender age of 50, I was asked a similar line of questions. Why? Especially why now? The answers are surprisingly similar. First, I have a deep love of my country and a desire to serve. And second, I had a critical wartime skill, over 20 years of experience in emergency medicine/trauma. Today I am seeing, as many Marylanders have, that we desperately need legislators who have real world, outside the Washington bubble, life skills. Governor Larry Hogan set the precedent for my campaign. He, too, was not a politician, but rather a successful citizen businessman. Timing is everything, and 2016 is going to be a pivotal year, particularly as we deal with problems of national security, rebuilding the economy, especially small business, and finding sustainable solutions in healthcare. The people of Maryland are looking for real, practical answers from people with real, practical experiences. I've had successful careers in the military, medicine, and business. I am not looking for another career in politics. But I know, now more than ever, time is crucial and the risk to our nation is significant. I look at my grandchildren and realize that if I want them to be safe and to have the opportunities that I had, I need to step up and make sure that I do what I can to make that happen.</p>"

We need to get rid of much of this regulation so that some of this money will be brought home. This would stimulate the economy because these dollars would be invested here.</p>",
    "q6":"Obama's only accomplishment is he made Gay cool. His biggest failure is his truthfulness. If his lips were moving, he was lying. His man-made climate change tirade 's a hoax. The climate has been changing for millions of long before humans got here. We've had ice ages and some how they disappeared. There's climate change on all the planets of the solar system. There is even climate change on the Sun. Once were elephants and jungles in the artic.That's where all that oil came from.He also failed to defend our borders allowing all manner of human beings to cross over.They're bringing diseases, pestilence, murder and mayhem. Many of these are Arab terrorist with intensions of destroying us.</p>",
    "q7":"I'm against an increase min wage. Very few people actually earn it. The people have take on more responsibility for their own life's outcome. Young women have to stop making families before they can afford them. Min wage hurts the economy. Companies may not be able to expand or hire additional personnel due to the expense. Min wage may keep some folks from starting businesses. It hurts young people's opportunities to gain work experience.</p>",
    "q8":"We need less gun control ... Most of the gun violence is perpetrated by boys growing up without fathers. When there're no fathers around, these young men are being raised by gangs and rap records. Without a man in their lives gently escorting them into manhood, the young men's view of the latter is distorted. They enter a world where shooting some is being a man.</p>",
    "q9":"Redistricting desperately needs reforms.The system is corrupt as hell.Now the Party in power manipulates the distrcts to keep power.The districts now look like they were drawn by chimps.The only purpose for the last redistricting was to get rid of a Republican seat. They move the Black citizens around to increase the black vote in that district. They were confident that the Blacks would the Democrats their vote.</p>",

    "q1":"Preventing Iran from building a nuclear weapon must be among our most important foreign policy priorities. While vigilant diplomatic efforts must be asserted to prevent Iran from ever obtaining a nuclear weapon, it is also vital that we keep all options on the table, including military force, when dealing with the Iranian state to ensure that the Iranian leadership understands the resolve of the international community on this issue. As a member of Congress, I would ensure that all agreements with Iran are closely monitored to ensure compliance. While I commend President Obama for negotiating an agreement with the international community to avert an immediate conflict with Iran, the recent negotiated Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action leaves many troubling issues—including a less than robust inspection and verification program, the immediate rather than gradual lifting of sanctions, and the unacceptably short, 15 year limitations period with verifiable constraints on Iran's nuclear program. Compliance with the international agreement will necessarily require close Congressional oversight.</p>",
    "q2":"ISIS is perhaps the fastest growing threat to our national security. It operates not only in Iraq and Syria, but consists of an international terrorist network across the Middle East and beyond, as well as an ideological movement of radical jihadism. The United States must target and defeat the entirety of ISIS. I concur with Secretary Clinton that America must lead in the fight against ISIS and \"Our goal is not to deter or contain ISIS but to defeat and destroy ISIS.\" Our strategy should be to defeat ISIS in Syria, Iraq, and across the Middle East. This involves an air campaign comprising our regional allies, with a no-fly zone over Syria, and with intelligence assets on the ground and local (not US) ground forces trained by US special operations forces to take back ISIS held territory. Our strategy must be to disrupt and dismantle the growing terrorist infrastructure that facilitates the flow of fighters, financing, and propaganda around the world. We can do this by sharing information with and insisting that our allies in the region step up their efforts. Through partnerships with local law enforcement and community leaders, especially with Muslim community leaders, we must identify causes and sources to prevent radicalization and recruitment in the US and abroad. Finally, our strategy must include hardening our defenses and those of our allies against external and homegrown threats. We have made significant progress since 9/11 and need to build on this progress and share our strategies with our allies.</p>",
    "q3":"The Trans-Pacific Partnership is an extremely complex agreement that seeks to expand and support jobs here at home by lowering barriers to trade and increasing labor, environmental, consumer protection and intellectual property standards abroad. While I generally support free trade agreements, not all past deals have benefitted the U.S. economy and workers. Under the North American Free Trade Agreement, our trade deficits with Mexico and Canada have escalated at rates higher than with other countries. Furthermore, it is well-documented that many manufacturing jobs have been lost to the offshoring of factories as a result of NAFTA. Regarding the TPP, I share the concerns expressed by many in industry and labor and among environmentalists. As a member of Congress, with access to the information necessary to make an informed decision, I would need to be satisfied that there are strong enough provisions to prevent Japan from engaging in currency manipulation, to ensure that corporate polluters do not get a free pass before international arbitration panels instead of U.S. Courts (where jurisdiction would be appropriate in our courts), to protect intellectual property rights of U.S. citizens and corporations, and to encourage greater investments in manufacturing jobs at home and not abroad. Congress has an important role in regulating trade among nations, and ensuring trade agreements support the U.S. economy and workers will be my guiding principle in deciding whether or not to support such agreements.</p>",
    "q4":"The Affordable Care Act has been one of the most significant accomplishments under President Obama's leadership and, as Lieutenant Governor, it was a privilege to work on the various implementation requirements of the ACA at the state level. While the launch of the health benefits exchange in Maryland was troubled with many problems at the outset, today hundreds of thousands of Marylanders have access to affordable, quality healthcare through the exchange. Looking forward, there are a number of provisions of the ACA that I believe need to be improved, for example expanding coverage to more categories of immigrants who do and will continue to access our health care system regardless of coverage. But one improvement that I would immediately seek to make as a member of Congress and should enjoy bi-partisan support in Congress is aligning the open enrollment period to buy coverage with the tax filing season when the incentives to purchase insurance or penalties for not doing so are squarely presented to taxpayers during tax season. This improvement to the functioning of the ACA would be similar to the existing Internal Revenue Service provisions that permit Individual Retirement Account contributions for the previous tax year to be made as late as the income tax filing deadline. As more and more Americans become more and more aware of the benefits and obligations under the ACA, we should continually seek to improve the functioning of the ACA.</p>",
    "q5":"The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act was designed to prevent the excessive risk-taking that led to the financial crisis in 2008. Key provisions in the law restrict banks from trading for their own profit and protect consumers and investors by creating and empowering the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to prevent mortgage companies and pay-day lenders from exploiting them. Although a key goal of the legislation was to prevent a rebuilding of a financial system that would permit banks to become so huge and intertwined that they would be \"too big to fail,\" the top banks today are bigger than they were in 2008. Many additional proposals have been made, primarily from Democrats, that I support. I support the reinstatement of Glass-Steagall to once again separate commercial banking from investment banking to better protect the public from risky investments. We need stronger regulations and regulators to enforce those provisions that allow for the breakup of big banks that make risky investments. I support a tax or \"risk fee\" on Wall Street speculation to discourage short-term risk taking and instead promote long-term investing. And I also support extending the provisions of Dodd-Frank to the so-called \"shadow banking\" sector—which includes certain activities of hedge funds, investment banks, and other non-bank financial companies—that makes up a quarter of the global financial system. Finally, I would support reforms to campaign finance laws that seek to reduce or eliminate Wall Street's influence in politics.</p>",
    "q6":"President Obama's legacy should be characterized a success, particularly on domestic policy. From saving the American economy from a second Great Depression caused in large part by a broken financial regulatory system, to enacting the most sweeping reform of healthcare—the Affordable Care Act—since the 1960s creation of Medicare and Medicaid, our nation is better off today than when President Obama took office in January 2009. He made college more affordable for millions of students and their families by increasing investments in the Pell Grant Program and reforming the student loan program. America has significantly increased renewable energy generation and the global climate change agreement reached in December is a major step forward. We are a much more inclusive society, particularly for the LGBT community. However, there continue to be areas where this nation has not made significant progress, yet much of it is attributable to a Congress that is simply unwilling to work with the President. There was a narrow window of opportunity in President Obama's first term for meaningful immigration reform, yet today the only way forward is by executive orders that are tied up in the courts. There have been far too many tragedies compelling us to adopt common-sense gun regulations, but President Obama's efforts have fallen on deaf ears in Congress. Today we live in a world that is less stable than it was eight years ago, with the rise of ISIS and continued instability in the Middle East, and a more aggressive Russia.</p>",
    "q7":"Yes, I support an increase in the federal minimum wage to $15.00 per hour and I support paid sick leave or family leave in both the public and private sectors and across every industry. As a member of the House of Delegates and again as Lieutenant Governor, I supported raising the minimum wage in Maryland, passing the first and only living wage in the nation, and expanding the prevailing wage. I also supported increasing the earned income tax credit as part of Maryland's 2007 tax reform. More and more Americans have fallen below the poverty line and too many working families are struggling to get by. While I believe that creating higher paying jobs in manufacturing, technology, and energy, along with increasing educational opportunities and vocational training, are essential components to raising wages and addressing income inequality in our country, the lowest paid workers need immediate relief. As such, I support proposals that provide greater wages and benefits to workers. Given that profits for the largest corporations in America have risen steadily while real wages have been stagnant, I firmly believe that a tax on the largest corporations to help fund a paid sick or family leave program is reasonable.</p>",
    "q8":"Public safety is the most fundamental responsibility of government and reducing the toll of gun violence is part of the larger public safety effort. To achieve safer communities, we must focus on our most violent offenders and those who put our communities most at risk. But we must also increase our investments to support offenders and ex-offenders who are re-entering our communities. By educating returning offenders and assisting them with housing, job opportunities, and counseling, we can reduce recidivism, reduce crime and end the revolving door of the criminal justice system. In Maryland, we enacted meaningful gun regulations after the shootings in Newtown, CT. Those regulations included enhanced background checks, mandatory fingerprinting and firearm instruction, as well as limitations on the size of magazines and a ban on assault weapons. As Lieutenant Governor, I strongly advocated in Annapolis and at town hall meetings across the state for these common-sense gun regulations. We need to enact similar legislation at the federal level, as well as eliminate loopholes that exist for gun shows. Furthermore, more must be done to identify and treat individuals with mental illnesses who are likely to do violence to themselves and others. That requires greater investments in community-based mental health services. I led the effort to give judges greater authority to order domestic abusers to surrender their firearms when a protective order is issued, and as a member of Congress I intend to continue the effort to take guns off our streets.</p>",
    "q9":"I believe that much of the dysfunction in Washington is due to the manner in which congressional district lines are drawn. As a result of partisan gerrymandering, there is a tendency among many members of Congress not to seek compromise and consensus across party lines. The issue needs to be handled at both the federal and state level. At the state level, independent commissions should be established to draw district lines. Whether the process resembles the one recently upheld by the Supreme Court in Arizona or the proposal recently introduced by Governor Hogan, states should adopt either through legislation or voter referendum independent commissions that provide for an open, fair and transparent redistricting process. However, one state alone cannot fix the larger dysfunction in Washington caused by partisan gerrymandering. As a member of Congress, I would support federal legislation, and a constitutional amendment if necessary, either to expressly prohibit a political party from enhancing or preserving its political power through redistricting or to require every state to adopt independent redistricting commissions. Finally, as we seek to reform congressional redistricting to eliminate partisan gerrymandering, we must also renew and amend as necessary the Voting Rights Act to ban racial discrimination in voting practices by the federal government, as well as by state and local governments. While Maryland has a good record on this issue, there are far too many Americans who have been deprived full access to the ballot by the laws and practices in states and localities across this country.</p>",
    "q10":"I'm running for Congress because I believe Maryland is a great state with strong communities, but we must strengthen our communities in order to strengthen our families. That work begins by ensuring economic prosperity for more Marylanders. We'll build a stronger Middle Class by growing our economy, creating jobs, building the most competitive workforce and new ladders of opportunity, modernizing our infrastructure, developing Maryland's small business community, and supporting strong families that have access to affordable, quality healthcare, safe neighborhoods, and a clean environment. As a member of Congress, those will be my priorities.</p>"

    "q1":"I am opposed to the agreement with Iran and will work to ending it immediately. Paying Iran American tax dollars when Iran has more money per capita for its citizens as a result of their oil assets than the U.S. does for American citizens illustrates that Iran does not care about its people, is holding the U.S. to what would be tantamount to being a hostage and will again move to continue developing nuclear weapons at a future date. This agreement does nothing to achieve the end goal of globally stopping the further development of nuclear weapons by all nations not currently posing a nuclear threat capability.</p>",
    "q2":"ISIS is a global threat to all non-Muslim nations. The U.S. in conjunction with our allies should coordinate through the FBI and Homeland Security using all of our resources to stop ISIS in their tracks and end any possibility of attack on our homeland or our embassies and consulates abroad.</p>",
    "q3":"No, after seven years of close-door negotiations with the public, press and policymakers locked out, the final TPP version was released. The document released is worse than expected, with the demands of the 500 official U.S. trade advisers representing corporate interests satisfied to the detriment of the public interest. The pact replicates many of the most controversial terms of past pacts that promote job offshoring and push down U.S. wages. I strongly support trade agreements that will promote job growth, preserve U.S. worker incomes and creates a fair exchange of goods and services operated on a level playing field so that a free market type environment is created and maintained.</p>",
    "q4":"The Obamacare plan has resulted in premiums charged that are not affordable by most of the insured, does not provide an adequate level of coverage and creates an environment counter-productive to our doctors and nurses that encourage them to find other career fields to pursue. We are losing our best doctors and nurses to other industries and employment solutions. This system must be restructured to reduce premiums so they are affordable by all, improve coverage, reduce prescription drug costs and limit lawsuit liability for the doctors and staff.</p>",
    "q5":"Government regulation has attempted to restrict Wall Street in band aid measures and forms of reform after the fact that have been ineffective and damaging to business, the growth in the number of high paying jobs, the growth in employee incomes and created an environment of maintaining accountability through further regulation reporting that has not provided the intended oversight. More has to be done to realign corporate philosophies on growth of industry and our nation in part and as a whole. Where government relations with corporate executives and their organizations have been in a sense \"at War\" they must be transformed into relationships of coorperation and encourage incentivized growth. Corporate leaders can make a positive difference in the lives of the American people. The issue is not to attempt to lock down and control the industry leaders but to provide legislation supporting the growth and improvement in business that will grow the economy thereby growing our Nation as a whole.</p>",
    "q6":"Most Americans view Barack Obama's foreign policies as having resulted in weakening our relationships with our key allies and worsening our relations with countries in the Middle East. The trade imbalances with other countries have significantly hurt our economy, resulted in the loss of jobs as corporations move their U.S. operations overseas and the removal of Christian references from our buildings and documents is viewed as negating much of our culture and heritage as it relates to the birth of our Nation and is not supported by the rational of separating church from state. The forced immigration of Muslim refugees without the support of Congress and the States is viewed as an immigration failure which is promoting fears of possible terrorist attacks on our homeland. The job market has not significantly improved where the people feel there is a sufficient choice of high paying jobs to support their struggling families and the downsizing of our military is leaving many Americans feeling vulnerable and weak. It is unfortunate that the Healthcare initiative has not been well received, marred by excessively high and unaffordable premiums for many Americans providing inadequate coverage for needed treatments along with the exit of many fine doctors, nurses and experienced staff to other industries. Collectively this has placed us in a position which is costing the American taxpayer an additional tax burden to support the program that is not working efficiently at all and the 19 trillion dollar deficit is strangling our once great Nation.</p>",
    "q7":"The issue of wages versus big corporate industry is an ongoing problem that is not fixable by just increasing the federal minimum wage. People need paid sick time and family leave but industry and the growth of high paying jobs need to be there to support the increase in expenses, especially in the foundation of our economic system which are the \"Small Business Owners\". Stimulating the significant growth of small business to be able to afford an increased federal minimum wage and the additional expense to the corporate bottom line for paid sick time and family leave is the highest priority in growing our economy. Without stimulating serious growth in our small business sector, significant improvement in overall economic growth and prosperity is not possible. Congress must find legislative solutions to reduce taxes that will get the small businesses to invest in their workforce and grow their companies. I believe small business owners would pay for the increase in wages, sick time and family leave time if their monthly bottom line didn't read close to zero profit each month.</p>",
    "q8":"We have legislation in place that makes it a felony for felons to apply for NICS checks and they are not prosecuted. We have legislation in place to require NICS checks for everyone purchasing a firearm but all of the states are not reporting all of their felony convictions into the NICS system so when convicted felons are checked in the system, the information about their convictions is not included. Legislation is in place to prosecute those that own firearms that through their own negligence or culpable and contributory actions their firearms are used in violent criminal acts. These gun owners are not prosecuted for their involvement and their crimes. Education in the storage and handling of and an increase in the penalties for inadequate control of owned firearms should be strengthened and legislation added where necessary. However, additional legislation to ban magazines and certain types of firearms is already in place and no additional restrictions are needed. Mental health issues must be addressed but not in a way that creates a situation of over reaching or confiscation of firearms that will violate the 2nd Amendment rights of all law abiding Americans. For the most part our firearms restrictive legislation already enacted is more than capable of reducing gun violence, we are not using the systems and tools already in place and adding more legislation treads over the line that is already infringing on Americans 2nd Amendment rights.</p>",
    "q9":"Yes. Maryland is the most District gerrymandered state in the union. If you were to view the Districts on a map, the resulting spaghetti designs give the Rorschach ink blots competition for being the most exotic. The realigning the Maryland Districts to conform to natural boundaries, population counts and county/city lines make more sense for campaigning and voter representation. Effective representation of constituents when District boundaries include members that are 50 miles apart is clearly impossible. Districting is about effective representation of constituents that share commonalities in geographic location, government boundaries and natural terrain boundaries. Racial or ethnic grouping, party affiliation grouping and support grouping are not applicable or beneficial to the voting process and they impede the representation efforts by the elected Congressional member.</p>",
    "q10":"I am committed to working for the people of Maryland District 4 with the same zeal and dedication I expended serving our Nation in the military as a U.S. Marine/Naval Officer. I have a very unique set of skills acquired in my military career and successes realized in business that enable me to be purposeful and result oriented in representing my District 4 constituents.</p>"

    "q1":"I have serious concerns about the treaty and how it will be enforced. Iran has consistently demonstrated itself to be untrustworthy in international affairs, especially in relations with the United States and our allies. We should be cautious in engaging with a regime that is still heavily influenced by radical religious extremists. But now that the agreement is in place, it is crucial that we insist on strict compliance with the agreed-upon terms on inspection and verification. During the continuing inspections and compliance protocols we must remain true to our values and goals of regional stability, preservation of human rights, nuclear non-proliferation, and protecting Israel which remains our strongest and most important ally in the region. We need to continue to push Iran to comply with this and all international agreements, which Iran continues to violate. We must continue to demand Iran stop funding terrorist groups like Hezbollah, developing international ballistic missiles, instigating unrest in the region, and providing weapons used against our allies, like Israel. </p>",
    "q2":"We must act deliberately to prevent a colossal mistake like the Bush administration's decision to invade Iraq. In Syria alone, there are numerous layers of intersecting alliances and loyalties among constantly shifting players. Ultimately, our goal is regional stability and the preservation of human rights. More immediately we must work diplomatically to curtail a long-term regional war based on a Sunni-Shia divide by maintaining our historic partnerships in the region. The recent negotiated settlement in Syria presents an opportunity to unite warring factions. We must continue our diplomatic efforts to bring these parties together to succeed against violent extremism perpetrated by abhorrent actors such as ISIS. I do support funding and military support to partners in the war against ISIS, but to be clear, I do not support accomplishing that effort with the use of American ground forces. </p>",
    "q3":"I do not support the TPP and other trade deals that lack strong enforceable protections for workers, the environment, currency values as well as basic human rights. In its current form, the TPP failed that test. Congress needs to bring transparency to the process of how it passes trade deals and consider the impact on the livelihoods of American workers, which could be devastating. It is not fair for American workers to be forced to compete against lower-paid foreign workers without strong protections in place. Furthermore, the deal must more robustly push regimes with long histories of human rights, trade, and labor violations towards reform. Instead of investing time and energy on a trade deal that will harm American workers, I want Congress to look to solutions we know will help workers today: raising the minimum wage, expanding paid sick and maternity leave for families, investing in early childhood care and education, and increasing investments in infrastructure projects that can put Americans to work right here in America. </p>",
    "q4":"Health care is a right. It is unacceptable that nearly 30 million Americans still do not have health care coverage. I am a strong supporter of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) because it has done tremendous good; it has expanded coverage to millions of Americans who did not have healthcare insurance before, improved the entire healthcare system in multiple ways, and significantly slowed the increase in health care costs. But, the ACA needs to be expanded and improved. I support the inclusion of a public option on the exchanges to achieve that. </p><p>A version of a public option was included in the House-passed version, but was killed in the Senate. The president wanted a public option included, and so did I. There would be more competition and the cost of insurance would drop for enrollees while generating savings in the system. In Congress, I will work to see that all Americans eventually have access to quality, affordable, and complete health care. </p>",
    "q5":"Yes. The 2009 Dodd-Frank bill was the most important financial reform legislation since the Great Depression, but much more needs to be done. The financial crisis that resulted in the Great Recession showed how irresponsible conduct on Wall Street can devastate lives on Main Street. Financial markets work safely and fairly only when there is adequate regulation. More reforms are needed to ensure our financial system is more secure and more fair. It is important to defeat Tea party Republican efforts in Congress to weaken or eliminate the Dodd-Frank reforms.</p><p>The new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) is doing vital work, but Republicans refuse to fully fund it or allow many of it's functions to begin. It needs to be fully funded and empowered. There needs to be increased accountability in the financial sector for both institutions and individuals. Financial institutions pay billions in fines for breaking the law, yet no individuals have been held personally responsible. This should change. Financial institutions should no longer be able to factor in fines as simply part of the cost of doing business. Serious violations should result in serious consequences. I support the President's budget proposal to double the Security and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Commodity Futures Trade Commission (CFTC) budgets by 2021. I also support taxing and regulating computer-driven high frequency trading. The goal of these needed reforms is to make the markets more secure, open, fair, and transparent.</p>",
    "q6":"The breadth and depth of the President's policy achievements in seven years is impressive. History will view the Obama era as a time of American success in a rapidly changing world. Despite incredible opposition, President Obama accomplished an overhaul of the American healthcare system while at the same time overseeing nearly six years of private sector job growth. The administration brought international cooperation and American leadership back, most notably by bringing almost 200 nations together to sign the Paris Climate Agreement to fight climate change. The President also reformed our student loan system to make college more affordable. He pushed Wall Street reforms through Congress to reign in Wall Street gambling and prevent a future crisis. Aside from policy, President Obama healed rifts and expressed our national conscience in reaction to many tragedies, especially in the wake of the 2015 Charleston church shooting. </p><p>The President has said his biggest disappointment has been his inability to persuade Congress to pass reasonable and common-sense reforms to fight gun violence, and his inability to improve the tone of political discourse. I think his opponents were unreasonable and certainly deserve their share of the blame.</p><p>I am running for Congress to preserve the accomplishments of President Obama and to continue his legacy of serving everyday people.</p>",
    "q7":"If you work a full time job, you deserve a living wage. Today, all too many Marylanders are working multiple jobs just to stay afloat. That's wrong. Raising the minimum wage to $15 will help to strengthen our families and our economy, which will benefit everyone. Similarly, as a father of six, I know the pressure of choosing between work and family. For many Americans that choice is cruelly stark, often having to choose between taking care of their sick child or losing their job. </p><p>A number of states and municipalities have implemented paid sick leave policies successfully. In Congress, I will be a strong leader in the fight for paid sick and maternity leave for families. I will also make fighting for equal pay for women and more employment training a top priority. I wholeheartedly agree with President Obama that we should grow the economy from the middle-out. To boost our economy, Congress needs to pass permanent middle class tax cuts to keep money in the pockets of working families. These policies could be paid for by closing corporate tax loopholes, cracking down on corporate off-shore tax havens, limiting corporate inversions, and implementing a small transactions tax on Wall Street speculation. Wall Street helped cause the Great Recession, and they should help to pay for the recovery. </p>",
    "q8":"I agree with President Obama that it's a political choice we make to allow gun violence in this country. Congress must take on the NRA and establish comprehensive common sense legislation to fight gun violence. Congress can save lives by implementing a few simple and responsible reforms.</p><p>For one, Congress should establish universal background checks on all gun sales to keep firearms out of the hands of dangerous people like violent offenders, domestic abusers, and the mentally ill. These background checks will close the gun show loophole and help crack down on illegal gun traffickers.</p><p>Congress should also hold the gun industry accountable. President George W. Bush signed unprecedented sweeping legislation immunizing the gun industry from lawsuits, even though many thousands of guns go missing from inventories of dealers' every year and wind up in the hands of criminals. We should demand the law be repealed, and the gun industry be held as accountable for its products and their business practices as every other industry.</p><p>Further, Congress should fund the ATF's inspection efforts. Irresponsible dealers are responsible for a significant portion of gun deaths in this country. If the ATF had the resources to properly enforce the law, these dealers would be forced to comply or face closure. Already, it is hard to identify which dealers are compliant because so few are inspected each year. The ATF simply does not have the resources to do its job. Congress can save lives tomorrow by funding the ATF today.</p>",
    "q9":"Free and fair elections are the bedrock of our democracy. Our system can best work when everyone has the unrestricted right to vote and big money does not control candidates. We can start by ensuring fair drawing of congressional districts so voters should choose their representatives NOT the other way around. When redistricting is left in the hands of politicians our democracy suffers. We must take the politics out of the district-drawing process and create a system that fairly represents the people. Mandating states use independent commissions for redistricting will ensure districts are drawn in accordance with law, and free of partisanship. But more needs to be done to safeguard our elections themselves. </p><p>Because our democracy works better when more voices contribute to it, Congress should work to encourage states to expand early voting, same day registration, and vote-by-mail programs. Removing obstacles to vote by increasing the number of days people can vote, allowing people to register the day of the election, and encouraging vote-by-mail programs are important tools for increasing participation in elections.</p>",
    "q10":"I am originally from Rocky Mount, North Carolina and have lived in the 4th Congressional district for over 27 years with my wife, former Maryland delegate, Jolene Ivey. I am the proud father of six children, including five sons who all attended public schools. </p><p>As State's Attorney, I transformed the office and made it work for people. I built a proven record of leadership taking on tough fights and achieving meaningful change for families - fighting domestic violence, pioneering re-entry programs for ex-offenders, mentoring and coaching our youth, and improving senior citizen programs, all without spending taxpayer dollars. Today, the United States Congress isn't working for everyday families. Tea Party Republicans care more about tearing down President Obama than finding real solutions to real problems. I am running for Congress to preserve the accomplishments of President Obama and to stop Tea Party Republicans as they attempt to cut vital programs like Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, and Obamacare. In Congress, I will be a strong leader in the fight to improve our schools and create jobs to strengthen families.</p>"

    "q1":"All-in-all, the Iran nuclear deal was the best one that could be negotiated with Iran by diplomats from the US and our allies. If Iran honors it, we will be safer. If Iran does not, we will re-impose sanctions on Iran and evaluate our other options to prevent Iran from making a nuclear weapon. The agreement will curb Iran's military nuclear weapons program while continuing to allow Iran to engage in a peaceful civilian nuclear power generation program. Iran gives up most of its centrifuges for enriching uranium and all the highly enriched nuclear material that could be used for bombs. Finally, the agreement will be monitored extensively by inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency and international sanctions may be quickly re-imposed on Iran if it breaks the agreement.</p>",
    "q2":"ISIS should be contained by the military forces of the countries in the middle east. America can provide advice, intelligence and training to support this fight, but should resist engagement on the ground with our troops.</p><p>As a general matter, our foreign policy should make America more secure, support our economic interests through fair trade, and promote the growth of democracies around the world because democratic governments are key to advancing human dignity, security and prosperity.</p><p>But US engagement shouldn't be predominantly military intervention in reaction to events. Our role should be to engage with our allies in the world's unstable countries to assist and build up local governments – like the Marshall Plan returned Europe to stability after World War II. As our experience in Iraq has shown, our military cannot substitute for effective local governments. The principle non-military tools to use first include cultural, economic and educational outreach that builds bridges to other nations and people around the world and spreads American and western values of pluralism and democracy, while helping to promote economic and social progress and stability. We should be promoting opportunities for advancement that include education, worker rights, environmental protection and public health. Smart, consistent aid of this kind can help to avoid larger future military deployments to quell unrest.</p>",
    "q3":"We should not agree to trade deals that create a race to the bottom that weakens the standards we have in the US. I am concerned that the Trans-Pacific Partnership will weaken state laws on the environment, health, and the nation's workforce. The dispute resolution procedures in the agreement give foreign investors the right to sue governments directly in offshore private investment tribunals, bypassing our courts or allowing a \"second bite\" if the investors do not like the results of domestic court decisions. The threat of these lawsuits could prevent states from ensuring a level playing field for workers and businesses and can make it more difficult to implement, or maintain, meaningful human rights, labor, health and environmental standards. Too often, free trade deals have hurt American industry and workers. We need to ensure that any deals include provisions for retraining workers adversely affected by new trade.</p>",
    "q4":"The Affordable Care Act is a tremendous achievement. Over 17 million formerly uninsured Americans now have the security of health care coverage and better health. Nevertheless, the president and others agree that the law could and should be improved.</p><p>One area to improve is coverage for families. An estimated four million families are not covered due to the \"family glitch\"; a provision in the law that prevents families from enrolling for coverage under a healthcare exchange if an \"affordable\" plan is offered by the employer of a family member. But this exclusion applies even if the employer only offers health coverage for just the worker, but not an affordable family plan. In these cases, families are priced-out of affordable family health coverage because they cannot get it from the employer or the government healthcare exchange. We can, and should, fix this problem by allowing these families to enroll on a healthcare exchange and qualify for a subsidy of the cost based on family income.</p>",
    "q5":"Banks are larger now than before the Great Recession of 2008-2009; and they're engaged in both commercial and investment banking. That's a problem because the risks in speculating on the stocks of companies and complex securities can backfire and cause a banking collapse. We have not solved the problem of banks that are \"too big to fail\" and, when the next financial crisis hits, we will again be faced with the difficult choice of whether to bail out the big banks to protect depositors and keep needed loans flowing to businesses.</p><p>We should separate commercial and investment banking. Investment banks that engage in risky, speculative transactions can then be allowed to fail without threatening the essential flow of money through commercial loans to businesses that keeps our economy humming along.</p><p>We also need to improve consumer lending regulation. We still see too many working families taken advantage of by complicated credit cards, abusive payday loans and shaky mortgage agreements, like balloon mortgages. And we still see disparities in minority access to credit, including charging minorities higher interest rates on things like home and auto loans. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau formed after the recession has worked to level the playing field and hold abusive lenders accountable. We need to protect this agency from Republican efforts to defund and dismantle it.</p><p>I sponsored the Maryland Consumer Protection Act, the Maryland Mortgage Fraud Protection Act and other pro-consumer legislation, and will continue to lead in this area in Congress.</p>",
    "q6":"President Obama has had a remarkably productive presidency, especially considering the concerted opposition of a Republican Congress to his initiatives. His greatest accomplishment is the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act which stimulated our economy out of the Great Recession. His administration saved the banking industry by cleaning their books of troubled financial assets, and engineered the restructuring of General Motors that saved that company and about 1 million auto industry jobs. </p><p>The president also put America back on track internationally. He drew down military forces in Iraq and Afghanistan, leaving security the principal responsibility of each country's government and forces that we trained. He ended the practice of \"enhanced interrogation\" of prisoners – essentially torture – which damaged America's world-wide standing. And he resisted engaging our troops in other conflicts around the world.</p><p>President Obama recognized the clear threat of climate change and helped bring about a precedent-setting international agreement among almost 200 countries. The agreement aims for zero net greenhouse gas emissions during the second half of this century, and attempts to limit the global temperature increase to 1.5 °C. Here at home he advanced clean energy research, energy efficiency, and environmental protection.</p><p>Our nation's inability to control guns is a significant failure. Repeated mass shootings by deranged and murderous people with easy access to weapons have left our nation less safe. Had the president's relationship with Congress been less fractured much more progress could have been made on this and other national challenges.</p>",
    "q7":"America's middle class is shrinking. It is harder now to find the solid manufacturing and union jobs that pay living wages. I voted to increase Maryland's minimum wage and I support increasing the Federal minimum wage. We should raise it to $15/hr. since the cost of living requires at least that much, particularly if you're caring for a child.</p><p>When I was young there was a period when my family was on welfare because my father left and did not make the child support payments my mother needed to keep a roof over our heads. She was a proud woman and she worked sewing in a New York garment district factory, and later in life as a hotel maid. She taught me that there is dignity in a job well done, and satisfaction in providing for your family. We should expand opportunities for minority businesses and small businesses, and promote successful training programs targeted to growing fields in the private and public sectors. We need to create new jobs, for example, by rebuilding crumbling roads and bridges, and water and sewer systems.</p><p>We cannot claim to believe in and support families without giving workers the means and flexibility to take care of their families – with paid sick leave and family leave. Mothers and fathers should be able to stay home to care for a sick child and not feel compelled to send a sick child to school because they cannot afford to miss a day's pay.</p>",
    "q8":"Congress has chosen to block legislation dealing with gun violence and gun control. The substantial influence of corporate money in politics – in this case money from the gun lobby – is to blame. How bad is it? Congress has actually prohibited our nation's public health agency, the CDC, from making recommendations on how to reduce gun deaths. So we lack the scientific basis for sound polices.</p><p>A sensible gun bill would start by removing the absurd prohibition on CDC gun violence studies. The background checks that apply now only to some gun purchases should be universally applicable. These checks should prevent criminals, people subject to domestic violence protective orders, and the mentally unstable from acquiring weapons. Gun owners also should take regular training in safe gun handling. Too many children die in accidents caused by adults who carelessly leave guns unattended and unsecured. And we should take a hard look at mental health treatment. Our current neglect of mental health treatment shows up in increased crime and the warehousing of the mentally ill in prisons instead of treatment in clinics and hospitals.</p><p>I fought the NRA to get an assault weapons ban into Maryland law. Progressive leaders in Congress need to harness the public outrage over gun violence, build a movement of angry voters nationwide that will outnumber, and out-influence, the NRA, and demand change.</p>",
    "q9":"Redistricting has a surprisingly profound effect on our democracy; and it must be reformed. The broken redistricting process has led to gerrymandered districts that encourage candidates to cater to the most extreme factions of their party. Once elected, the representative then owes his or her position to that extreme party element and cannot work across the aisle towards compromise solutions. The result is government gridlock, polarizing rhetoric, and little real progress for the nation.</p><p>Since district boundaries are usually drawn by the state legislature (or a commission appointed by the legislature), and the outcome is controlled by the party in power, the districts favor the continued re-election of the controlling party and dilute the power of the opposition. Strange, octopus-like, gerrymandered districts emerge.</p><p>I was the primary sponsor of the No Representation Without Population Act, a landmark 2010 civil rights law that was challenged all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court and upheld. The law ensures fair representation for Maryland's urban areas by counting the state's prison inmates at their last home address rather than in rural prison communities. I was also one of only a handful of legislators that co-sponsored redistricting reform measures in Maryland.</p><p>We can fix the redistricting process by appointing independent commissions to draw district lines, guided by criteria in law such as the goal of making each district \"compact\" and consistent with other natural boundaries. A federal law implementing these \"best practices\" across the nation would provide the fairest result.</p>",
    "q10":"I believe in service and have represented both Anne Arundel and Prince George's Counties for nine years. I have fought for Maryland's values of fairness and inclusiveness, and to build a stronger community – even when it is not easy. I want to keep fighting for fairness in Congress.</p><p>I know you share my deep disappointment with Congress these days. It will not be easy to fix, but we've got to step up to the task. I rolled up my sleeves and did the hard work to get more than 50 bills into law in Maryland — important laws that protect people against discrimination, improve health care, protect the Chesapeake Bay, fund our public schools, and promote sustainable transportation. I did it by listening to my constituents, talking to stakeholders from all sides, and building coalitions of supporters who back reasonable solutions. I will do the same for you in Congress.</p>"

    "q1":"I believe that achieving the goal of preventing Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons peacefully was a huge success. My only criticism of the deal itself is a lost opportunity to push for wider adoption of solar power. Iran's desire to pursue non-fossil fuel domestic power is laudable, but had we offered to work with them on building a green energy program, the concern surrounding the possibility that they might turn a domestic nuclear power program to military uses would be a non-issue. The deal is also a victory for Iranian moderates who are seeking wider engagement with the rest of the world. I will admit to being concerned by the response of some of our politicians to the deal, where Republicans are claiming they will tear it up, and even some Democrats are marrying congratulations with threats of military force. \"Do what I say or I will bomb you out of existence\" is not diplomacy, it is bullying.</p>",
    "q2":"The best thing we can do with regards to ISIS is to work with local governments to stabilize the region. Al Qaeda, which has been largely forgotten, ISIS, and other similar terrorist groups thrive on instability. Every country that lacks a stable government is a potential safe haven for terrorists, and every population that lives in fear is a potential pool for recruitment. That means we have to end our policy of regime change, stop selling weapons to brutal governments, and start using diplomacy to calm down tensions in the region. As far as actually fighting ISIS, that has to be the responsibility of the countries in the area. The United States is widely seen as a hostile occupying force, and an aggressive campaign of air strikes is doing nothing to help that perception. What we should do instead is provide aid to those who have been hurt by the conflict. Send in food and clean water, rebuild homes, schools, and hospitals. If we are seen as a force for good in the region, the radical propaganda will be seen for a lie and recruiting will dry up.</p>",
    "q3":"I firmly oppose the Trans-Pacific Partnership. Historically, free trade deals have been devastating to our trade balance, as companies move to outsource work in search of lower wages. It is difficult to find things that are \"Made in America\" not because there is no demand for them, but because it is cheaper to make them elsewhere. Trade deals that are written by major multinational corporations, with minor if any input from labor interests, are not going to be good for average Americans. Trade is important, but these deals are not about trade - they're about giving more and more power to major corporate interests, and we can't accept that.</p>",
    "q4":"I believe that the Affordable Care Act did a lot of good in terms of reining in the worst abuses of the insurance industry, but it should be seen as a temporary measure. A bandage to stop the bleeding until we can do the hard work of fixing the system. We have 29 million people around the country who lack health insurance, and millions more who have insurance, but still don't get the care they need because they can't afford the co-pays or deductibles. I agree with Senator Bernie Sanders that health care should be a right of all people, not a luxury of the rich, and that in order to make that a reality we need to implement a single payer health care system. Expanding Medicare to all people is the easiest path to that goal, but I believe that the VA health care system can also teach us lessons on keeping costs down. There is no reason Americans should pay so much more for prescription medication than any other country on the planet, and it has to end.</p>",
    "q5":"The steps taken so far to increase regulation of Wall Street are a good start, but there is still a lot of work to be done. We need to reinstate Glass-Steagall, and modernize it to address modern banking practices. Additionally, we need robust campaign finance reform, because until we do that, Wall Street will simply throw money into electing people who will defend their interests. Another problem is the practice of having outside organizations write legislation that is then introduced by members of Congress. This problem is magnified by the fact that so many people are too busy spending hours a day fundraising to actually read legislation before voting on it. The only way we're going to fix that is by encouraging people to run who are more interested in the legislative process than in playing politics.</p>",
    "q6":"I would say that President Obama's legacy has been mixed. He did a phenomenal job in leading us out of the worst recession most people living have ever seen. His work pushing through the Affordable Care Act ended some of the worst abuses of the insurance industry, and expanded care to millions of people who were previously uninsured. However, median income has actually fallen, the \"too big to fail\" banks that led us into the crisis are even bigger than they were before the collapse, and a tremendous opportunity was missed with the failure to make a serious attempt to include a public option with the ACA. The biggest disappointment, to me, was his fighting for the TPP. This was especially surprising given the fact that in 2008, he attacked Hillary Clinton over her support for NAFTA. To use a medical analogy, he took a country that was in critical condition, and stabilized us. That is incredibly important. But stable isn't healthy, and healthy should be our goal.</p>",
    "q7":"I am a strong supporter of the Fight For $15, and think that anybody who works full time should make enough to support themselves. When we have full time employees who are homeless because they can't afford a place to live, that is simply unacceptable. Additionally, it is disappointing that the ideas of paid sick leave and family leave are remotely controversial. Many people live paycheck to paycheck, and having those be unpaid puts people in an untenable position. That's how you get people showing up sick to work, which exposes everyone else to the illness and lowers productivity. It's how you get parents of infants forced to go back to work so they can pay the bills when they should be bonding with their child. But I will even go a step further than that. With the trend of companies offshoring their operations and automating work done here in the US, I believe that we need to start working to implement some form of Universal Basic Income. Mass automation is used as an argument against raising the minimum wage, and yet we completely ignore the fact that it's going to happen anyway. We can't wait until millions of people lose their jobs before we start figuring out how we'll take care of them. Putting them all in prison is not an acceptable answer to me.</p>",
    "q8":"There are several separate paths that Congress should address concurrently. The first is ensuring that people who should not have guns do not get them - this means universal background checks, including for private sales.It also means getting tougher on straw purchases. </p><p>Second, we need to look at ways to prevent accidental shootings. The fact that a toddler can get their hands on a gun and shoot someone has got to be addressed. I don't have any specific ideas on that point, other than pushing for more widespread adoption of smart guns, but that's a conversation we need to be having. </p><p>Third, suicides comprise 2/3 of gun deaths. It is easier and cheaper for someone who is depressed to purchase a gun and kill themselves than it is for them to seek help. Universal health care that includes mental health is an important step in addressing that problem, but we also need to fight the stigma that currently surrounds seeking help for mental health issues.</p>",
    "q9":"Along with campaign finance, the congressional redistricting process is one of the biggest problems corrupting the political process. Justice Ginsburg famously said \"Voters should choose their representatives, not the other way around.\" Politics should have no role in the drawing of congressional districts. The Census Bureau has professional cartographers and demographers that could draw the districts according to specifications, or even more simply, there are a number of ways that a computer program could do it, removing even the appearance of bias. When a candidate for elected office is asked what area their district covers, the answer should be simple, not a needlessly complex drawing on a map.</p>",
    "q10":"We currently have a problem with our elected officials focusing so much on their next election that they fail to plan for the long term. That has led us to a cycle of crisis to crisis governance, which is simply unsustainable. I believe I will bring a different perspective to the national conversation that can help us solve the major problems we will be facing in the coming years. These are problems that can't be solved at the last minute. When cities are underwater is the wrong time to take action on climate change, and when millions of people have been automated out of work is the wrong time to talk about building a robust social safety net. It will take years to work out solutions to these issues and to get those solutions implemented, which means we have to start now.</p>"

Between President Bush's last year in office, President Obama has brought the unemployment rate down from 7.2% to 5.1%. The rate of uninsured Americans dropped from 15% to 9.2%. Teen pregnancy was cut in half, Iran centrifuges cut by 2/3 and GDP Growth is up 3.4 %. The bottom line is that this president, like others before him, will be judged by history.

    "q1":"The agreement is a disaster. Since 1979 one of the bedrock principles of our policy in the Middle East has been the containment of the radical Islamic Republic of Iran. We have now abandoned that policy, enriched the Iranians and turned them loose to export terror across the globe. I have worked against the Iranian intelligence service and Qods force in the field. I am intimately familiar with the Iranian nuclear weapons program. This agreement will not stop the Iranians from getting nuclear weapons, and it will not make us or anyone else safer.</p>",
    "q2":"We should not put American conventional ground troops on the ground in Iraq and Syria. We should work with tribal forces, moderate resistance groups and allied nations to destroy ISIS. American special forces, intelligence officers and air power in combination with local allies on the ground can destroy this threat, if we have leadership in Washington willing to take the fight to the enemy. I took the first CIA team into Iraq in 2002 in advance of the invasion of that country. I have worked with Kurdish forces on the ground in that region. I understand the threat and how to counter it. At home, we need to take seriously the threat ISIS poses as well. We need aggressive law enforcement and intelligence operations to identify jihadists and take them off the street before they can act. I have done this work for decades. I understand what needs to be done.</p>",
    "q3":"I support fair trade not free trade. Trade agreements pursuant to which all parties play the rules and a level playing field is established are beneficial to all parties. Historically, however, other nations have exploited these agreements to their advantage, have cheated and manipulated the system to the detriment of our economy. We have lost jobs. We have lost a great deal of our manufacturing base. Until and unless the U.S. Government is going to standup to foreign abuse of free trade agreements I will not support the TPP or any other similar proposal.</p>",
    "q4":"Repeal it. The central problem with our health care system is the spiraling cost of care. Obamacare does nothing to address that issue. Costs continue to rise in a way that is unsustainable. We, as a nation, simply cannot afford to pay these bills. We need to restore free market forces to health care in a way, which will drive down cost and maximum individual choice. That means, among other things, health savings accounts, allowing the purchase of health care across state lines and equalizing the tax treatment of health care plans so people are not dependent on health care provided by their employers.</p>",
    "q5":"I am not a supporter in general of vast legislation imposing complex regulatory requirements and empowering bureaucrats to intrude themselves into the running of private enterprises. I do not think they are effective. I do think they create drag on the economy, discourage growth and, ultimately, kill jobs.</p><p>Dodd-Frank is a classic example of such legislation. It is government overreach at its worst, and it should be repealed. I do support an updated version of Glass-Steagall to restore the wall between commercial and investment banking. I also wholeheartedly support aggressive prosecution of individuals involved in illegal activity connected to investments and banking. If we can find the resources to prosecute a man who steals a few hundred dollars from a liquor store we can certainly find the resources to prosecute a man who steals millions from retirees and working class families.</p>",
    "q6":"When President Obama came to office I believe most Americans hoped that he would make good on his promise to bring Americans together and to find common ground. Unfortunately, I, like most Americans I think, feel that he has failed and that the policies he has pursued in office bear little resemblance to those he purported to support when campaigning.</p><p>Our foreign policy is a disaster. We have abandoned our allies and emboldened our enemies. Our middle class is under siege and dissolving. Our southern border is largely unsecured, and we are no closer to resolving the problem of illegal immigration than we were when the President came to office. I think, unfortunately, that the Obama legacy will be one of weak leadership, squandered opportunities and policies, which ran contrary to the desires of the majority of the American people.</p>",
    "q7":"I would be willing to entertain the possibility of a modest increase in the federal minimum wage. I think, however, we should talk less about the minimum wage and more about jobs that pay a living wage. We need to get this economy moving again and start creating jobs on which you can raise a family and support a middle class lifestyle. That job growth will not come from the government. It will come from private industry. We need to cut taxes, reduce regulation and create the conditions for economic expansion. I do not support federal mandates for sick leave and family leave.</p>",
    "q8":"We have two problems with handgun violence in this country. First, we have a large number of individuals, mostly young males, killed in urban areas with cheap handguns procured off the black market. Increased regulation of the legal sale of firearms, making it more and more difficult for law-abiding citizens to buy guns, does next to nothing to impact this problem. If the federal government is serious about addressing this issue it should begin by regaining control over our southern border and shutting down the drug trade that fuels most urban violence and by going after the gun trafficking networks that are smuggling arms in large numbers into our cities.</p><p>Our second problem with gun violence concerns a relatively small number of horrifying mass shootings. Virtually without exception, the perpetrators of these attacks are mentally ill individuals who have been left to spiral out of control and ultimately to commit mass murder. The federal government should be leading the charge to reform mental health and to provide the laws and tools we need to get these kinds of individuals off the street before they kill.</p>",
    "q9":"The drawing of congressional district lines should not be left to a partisan political process. There should be a non-partisan mechanism that creates common sense, cohesive districts and does away with the ridiculous gerrymandering we see today. This process should take place at the state level. The federal government has already usurped far too many functions of the states.</p>",
    "q10":"I think we are in trouble as a nation and are threatened both domestically and abroad. I am tired of recommending someone else do something about it. I think it is time to get off the sidelines and get involved.</p>"

    "q1":"For many years the Revolutionary Iranian Government has demonstrated nothing but hate and contempt for the American people and our way of life. They overran our embassy, American soil, in the late 70's and held dozens of American citizens hostages, threatening there lives every day for over four hundred days. The have built roadside bombs and IED's to kill American soldiers and maim innocent civilians in an effort to undermine the freedom we brought to the people of Iraq. They are sponsoring terror though their clients such as Hezbollah and Hamas. They openly call for the destruction of America (the Great Satan) and Israel, our strongest ally in the Middle East. They have set in motion the need for other Arab nations to build the bomb to protect themselves. They have upended all chances of stability in the region and we are now giving them over $100B and the right to carry out nuclear research with very little oversight. They will build a bomb and they will build or buy the ballistic missile capability to deliver those weapons to Israel, Western Europe and the US. They will have the means to destroy Israel in less than 20 years. I support Israel. I don't think this deal will result in a nuclear free Middle East.</p>",
    "q2":"ISIS is a well funded and established global terrorist organization with affiliates ready and willing to fight beside them. There are reportedly over 30,000 men and women fighting for ISIS in Syria and Iraq. They represent the very worst of humanity. They have killed tens of thousands of innocent civilians. They have tortured, raped and killed American journalists. The have kidnaped and killed aid workers with beautiful souls who only wanted to ease the suffering masses in Syria and the region. ISIS has burned men alive in cages. They have cut the heads off of babies and tiny children just because their families believed in Jesus Christ. They were in the process of beheading over 80 innocent men when Kurds and American Special Forces rescued them at the cost of one precious American life who had already sacrificed so much. They cannot be reasoned with on any level. There is no negotiating. They must be destroyed by overwhelming offensive forces and I will support the President and the Secretary of Defense when they make the decision to move decisively to make that happen.</p>",
    "q3":"The Trans-Pacific Partnership is another in a long line of trade deals that have led to the loss of high paying and or good paying jobs in manufacturing and other industries to China, Mexico and India. These jobs have been lost for decades, starting with NAFTA and many economists say that they are not coming back. If you look at the legislation for the TPP and the associated legislation you will find government subsides to pay for retraining or otherwise supporting the thousands of Americans who are going to loose their jobs because of this new round of trade deals. The AFL-CIO stands firmly against the TPP. We stand with the AFL-CIO. Our opponent in this campaign not only supported the TPP as an affront to the AFL-CIO, but provided leadership from within the Democratic Party to pass this bill. This was a piece of legislation rooted in the Republican Party and my opponent, a Democrat, got in bed with the Republicans and orchestrated its passage. It is unheard of for a Democratic leader to move aggressively against the AFL-CIO to side with the Republicans on something that will cost the AFL-CIO and other unions thousands of jobs. I stand firmly against the TPP. It was my stated position from the very beginning. It has been on my website from the very beginning and I will work to reverse this legislation and its impact on the people of Maryland's 5th Congressional District and the rest of the nation.</p>",
    "q4":"The ACA could be great legislation, however, promises were made and opportunities missed. Your question asks for \"one thing\" and I feel compelled to list many, but I will limit my response to meet your request. Let the American People purchase health insurance across state lines by eliminating the McCarran Ferguson Act of 1946. This act allows all health care insurance providers to meet in smoke filled rooms and set prices without fear of the Sherman Anti Trust Act or any other anti trust legislation. When an industry is sanctioned by Congress to conduct price fixing and limit the sale of insurance to a geographical area, insurance companies can manipulate prices and set them as high as the market can bear. It is insidious and detrimental to the American way of life. Eliminate the McCarran Ferguson Act and you set America on a long, beneficial course to lowering the cost of health insurance and health care costs. In February 2010 the House of Representatives voted to repeal the McCarran Ferguson Act with a bipartisan vote of 406 to 19, but it was never addressed in the US Senate.</p>",
    "q5":"In the 1990's the Clinton Administration moved to repeal the Glass Steagall Act that prevented most of the criminal acts carried out by our banks and financial institutions during the Bush Administration. After the collapse of the world economy in 2008, Congress and the President moved aggressively to restore health to the financial sector, imposed over $18B in fines and instituted a number of wide ranging regulations to improve the chances of avoiding another year like 2008. However, these acts are woefully insufficient. We must reinstitute some form of banking regulation and separation between investment banking and all other forms of banking. This may mean the reinstitution of Glass Steagall or some other act that performs essentially the same thing. To your second question, I say yes. More must be done. It is my intent to reinstitute Glass Steagall.</p>",
    "q6":"Legacies are a long time coming. How we view him today is not how we will view him years down the road. His being the first black president will be the first thing historians will say as they describe his presidency. I believe we will go through a period where there will be those who will say lofty words and sing his praises, then the pendulum will swing. But in the end, he will be viewed as many good and descent presidents who took a bad situation and did everything he could to make it better. His heart and his soul are in the right place and his love of this country is great. I also believe that history will criticize some of his advisors who influenced his premature departure from Iraq, while generally giving him credit for working closely with men like Robert Gates. His handling of the crises in the Middle East will not go well in history, but the Affordable Care Act will simply become Obamacare and he will long be remembered for the impact it made on our society as a whole. He is a man that said he would walk down any aisle to bring Democrats and Republican together for the greater good of the American People and in this regard, it was his greatest failing.</p>",
    "q7":"Yes. I support an increase in the federal minimum wage. This has been my position for years and unlike many of my fellow Democrats, I do not support $10.10 per hour. Instead, I support a living wage where families can actually eat descent food and put a roof over their children's heads and live in a neighborhood that has a great school. I have advocated openly for $15 per hour as the national minimum wage and an expansion of the Earned Income Tax Credit. Yes, it's a no brainer that we need federally required paid sick time and family leave.</p>",
    "q8":"Every gun should have a lock. The use of that lock is something for the mom's of American (and others) to decide if they are going to be used or not. Our plan is to send five gunlocks to every home in America once every few years. You can read our full plan on our website. In addition, Congress could defund agencies of the federal government and stop giving grants to states that will not enforce the laws we currently have. We intend to make it illegal for anyone who has ever been a member of a Gang or associated with a Gang to own, hold or otherwise have any type of firearm. Law Abiding Citizens should be protected under the Second Amendment in the same way that everyone should be protected under the First Amendment. If you take away one right, you will eventually take away all of them.</p>",
    "q9":"From time to time, Congressional Districts should be redrawn. The task is one for the individual states, not the Federal Government. I believe that the people should pick their representatives instead of the representatives picking the voters. This seems to be happening too often in places like Maryland and Texas. I would hope that one day, cool heads will prevail and common sense raise its head and we all decide that a geographically condensed area that has people of essentially equal populations be identified across a state and marked as a Congressional District without counting the number of potential voters for one party or another. Let's all grow up and let the people decide who will best represent them and call it a day.</p>",
    "q10":"I'm running because more members of Congress need to be focused on the average American. We have 20M unemployed and underemployed Americans in the US, probably more and the numbers are growing. There are over 250,000 unemployed Vets, 50,000 homeless Vets and 22 Vets are committing suicide every day. I cannot begin to describe to you the sadness I feel when I look back on the 20 years we spent protecting soldiers and civilians in one war torn part of the globe after another only to come home and find that we don't protect them on our own soil. All the while our politicians were self-promoting or working with pundits and political hacks to progress their personal agendas or looking for ways to posture for positions. To think that the sacrifices seen in Arlington Cemetery and countless home town graveyards and mass graves in third world regions are so easily dismissed so that someone here in Washington can move up the political ladder is heartbreaking to me. I won't lump my representative with that crowd, even if he is one of the most powerful men in Washington. But he has failed to change the culture. He can't change the culture and that is exactly what I will do. You can see what I have accomplished by my work in human rights for years. I can and will change the culture in Washington. That is one of the reasons I feel compelled to run for Congress.</p>"

    "q1":"The nuclear agreement expands Iran's nuclear breakout window from just a few weeks to a full year, giving the United States, Israel, and our European and Gulf allies a greater ability to prevent Iran from achieving a nuclear weapons capability. However, I believe the agreement came short of our goals. Specifically, the agreement gave too much to Iran and demanded too little in return. It only partially meets the objectives of the international community within a limited time period in return for fully and permanently lifting nuclear-related sanctions. That's why I've been a leader in calling for the most vigorous monitoring and enforcement regime possible - and for America to play a leading role in ensuring Iran abides by its commitments. In addition, I've made clear that we must take such action as is necessary to assure Iran's compliance with existing U.N. resolutions directed at Iran's non-nuclear activities, which undermine security and stability in the Middle East. </p>",
    "q2":"The United States needs to lead and apply the resources necessary to accomplish the mission of destroying ISIL. That includes strengthening efforts to reconstitute the Iraqi military so that it can retake Mosul; squeezing ISIL in its headquarters, Raqqah; and working with partners such as the Kurds to eliminate ISIL's territorial stranglehold in the region. I support efforts among Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and the UAE to deploy those nations' troops to Syria to fight ISIL, and I encourage the Obama Administration to increase its efforts to demolish ISIL's energy resources and work with Turkey to seal its borders from foreign fighters. </p><p>Ultimately, though, military efforts will not be successful without a political settlement, consensus on dealing with Assad, and robust response to the humanitarian catastrophe. Russia has made clear it is willing to stake blood and treasure on propping up the Assad regime, and I believe that the United States and our allies must continue working to convince Russia to be part of the solution instead of part of the problem. </p><p>ISIL's ideology is pernicious, evil, and dangerous and – as demonstrated by the attacks in Paris and San Bernardino – contagious among those who might become radicalized, even within our country. We need to ensure the intelligence community is fully coordinated with federal, state, and local law enforcement to prevent lone-wolf attacks. I also support counter-radicalization efforts to combat recruitment. ISIL presents a dual threat, both as a destabilizing force in the region and as a counterterrorism challenge globally.</p>",

In 2012, the Supreme Court upheld the Affordable Care Act while ruling that one of its key provisions—the expansion of Medicaid—must be optional for states. Over 17 million previously uninsured Americans have gained coverage under the law and 31 states, led by both Democrats and Republicans, have expanded their Medicaid programs. Because of Medicaid expansion in Maryland, more than 600,000 Marylanders enrolled in Medicaid in 2015. </p><p>Unfortunately, 19 states have refused federal funding for Medicaid expansion, despite the demonstrated social and economic benefits. I would urge each of these states to expand their Medicaid programs to ensure access to preventive care and other needed medical services for our country's most vulnerable families. According to the Kaiser Family Foundation, this would provide access to affordable health care coverage for nearly 3 million uninsured Americans in those states.</p>",
    "q5":"Yes. Wall Street is being held more accountable while consumers are being protected from misleading and abusive lending practices. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act safeguards Americans from the kind of reckless behavior that took place in our financial markets in the years leading up to the near-collapse of our financial system – and which led to the loss of millions of jobs and weakened our economy. </p><p>I will continue to work with my colleagues to oppose efforts to weaken the Dodd-Frank law while also strengthening the law to ensure that our financial markets are the safest in the world, that private sector growth continues, and that our middle class has access to the tools and opportunities they need to get ahead in today's new economy.</p>",
    "q6":"Under President Obama's leadership, his Administration has helped to restore our economy and provide Americans with access to opportunities to adapt to today's new economy. Our economy has seen seventy-one consecutive months of private sector job growth, with over 14 million private sector jobs created since the President took office. More jobs have been added over the past two years than in any two-year period since 1998-2000. In addition, the unemployment rate has dropped to 4.9 percent, the lowest since February 2008. </p><p>Also under President Obama, millions of Americans have gained access to affordable health coverage. Patients cannot legally be denied coverage due to a pre-existing condition, be subjected to annual and lifetime coverage limits, or be charged a higher rate just for being a woman. In Maryland alone, more than 162,000 individuals enrolled in health coverage for 2016. According to Gallup, the uninsured rate in Maryland was down from 12.9 percent in 2013 to just 7 percent in mid-2015.</p><p>I am also proud that President Obama's first action was signing the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act into law to make it easier for women to fight against pay discrimination. The enactment of that law was a significant milestone in the march toward full equality by providing women with legal recourse if they had been paid less than their male counterparts in prior years. </p>",
    "q7":"I have cosponsored legislation to raise the federal minimum wage to $12 an hour by 2020. The current minimum wage of $7.25 an hour has not been raised for seven years. In 1968, the minimum wage was over $10.50 an hour in 2015 dollars. Americans overwhelmingly support raising the minimum wage as do many businesses. A higher minimum wage will help more people not only stay afloat financially but also help them start to get ahead.</p><p>I also cosponsored the Federal Employees Paid Parental Leave Act (FEPPLA), a bill which would provide six weeks of paid leave for federal employees for the birth, adoption, or fostering of a child. More broadly, Congress should take action to protect workers in our economy from having to choose between losing their jobs or staying home to care for themselves or for a sick child. </p>",
    "q8":"Congress should close the loopholes in our laws that enable violent criminals and those on terror watch lists from being able to purchase dangerous firearms legally without a background check. Studies show that every day where background checks are used, the system stops more than 170 felons, some 50 domestic abusers, and nearly 20 fugitives from buying a gun.</p>",
    "q9":"I believe strongly that the 114th Congress should adopt a law requiring all states to establish nonpartisan or bipartisan redistricting commissions, similar to those in Arizona and Iowa.</p>",
    "q10":"It is an honor to represent Maryland's Fifth Congressional District, and I am proud to work across the aisle to deliver results for my constituents. I have been successful in helping to create and save thousands of jobs in and around the Fifth District at federal facilities and military installations such as NASA Goddard, NOAA Center for Weather and Climate Prediction, and the FDA Center for Food Safety in College Park. I am also leading the Make It In America jobs plan in Congress to spur the creation of well-paying jobs in our country. I am dedicated to improving Maryland schools and keeping them among the best in the nation, as well as investing in our infrastructure and keeping our neighborhoods safe. I have served as a strong advocate for the over 62,000 federal employees in our district. I've also worked to protect our natural resources, including the Chesapeake Bay, and improve veterans' access to health care. I would like to continue this work on a bipartisan basis to deliver results and improve the quality of life for Fifth District families.</p>"

    "q1":"I vehemently oppose the Iran agreement. The Administration agreed to provide the world's leading state sponsor of terrorism with more than $100 billion, allowing Iran to further develop its ICBM program and to finance its efforts to support terrorist organizations. The inspection regime is woefully insufficient. What is particularly disturbing are the \"side agreements\" between the IAEA and Iran. Our Congress was not allowed access to those agreements – essentially putting the United States in a situation of agreeing to a contract that it cannot even read. The Administration has made the world more dangerous and has placed the United States and our key ally Israel at substantial risk.</p>",
    "q2":"First and foremost, the United States must repeal sequestration and bolster the defense budget so that the military has the resources it needs to confront and defeat the threat of ISIS. But we must also recognize that the threat of ISIS exists here in the homeland, as well. We must address immigration weaknesses and failures, secure our borders, and prohibit the influx of Syrian refugees until we can confirm they are refugees and not ISIS infiltrators.</p>",
    "q3":"Maryland lost 1,500 jobs after NAFTA. I am concerned that the TPP, as it stands now, presents a risk to Maryland workers and jobs because it would incentivize companies to move more jobs overseas. We must carefully scrutinize such agreements to ensure that its provisions benefit American workers and businesses, not penalize them.</p>",
    "q4":"While working to repeal Obamacare, there are provisions that could be remedied immediately. To help small businesses, I would propose raising the number of employees triggering the Obamacare mandate from 50 to 100. This would reduce the regulatory burden on small businesses and minimize the move toward a part-time job economy. I would also allow cross-state-border access to the healthcare insurance exchanges, creating competition that would likely result in considerably lower costs for insurance.</p>",
    "q5":"The Administration and a Democrat-controlled Congress went way too far in overregulating American businesses. Dodd-Frank imposed over 400 new rules and regulations, mandates that have stifled job creation. These rules have been particularly burdensome for small and medium-sized businesses that cannot afford in-house compliance and counsel. Further, this law enshrined \"too big to fail,\" thereby putting taxpayers on the hook for future bailouts. It is time to bring common-sense solutions back to Washington.</p>",
    "q6":"President Obama's legacy has been one of failure and disappointment. His single greatest failure is the Iran agreement, which has put the American people and our allies at substantial risk. I am not aware of any successes.</p>",
    "q7":"I do not support an increase in the federal minimum wage because such increases stifle job creation and will result in fewer jobs available. Before the federal government imposes additional requirements on paid sick time and family leave, it must consider the impact on small businesses. Small businesses need flexibility to find solutions that work for their particular situations and needs. Along with many other issues, the overarching theme of my approach is to minimize government mandates and regulations! This does not accomplish that goal.</p>",
    "q8":"Multiple federal gun laws already exist. Before enacting new laws, the Administration should enforce laws that are already on the books. It must be careful not to infringe upon the Second Amendment rights of the American people. Having said that, I do believe that more must be done – at state, local, and community levels primarily – to ensure that individuals with mental health disorders receive the help they need. </p>",
    "q9":"I support Governor Hogan's efforts to reform the redistricting process to create more geographically sensible districts in Maryland. This should be a state issue. We do not need the Federal government imposing into the needs and priorities of Marylanders.</p>",
    "q10":"I am gravely concerned about our country's national security posture. We face the greatest threats in our nation's history, yet this Administration not only would reduce the U.S. military posture but also has taken steps that have resulted in severe degradation of our international standing. Instead of bolstering our national security to deal with terrorism, the Administration has focused on ill-conceived agreements with Iran and China, agreements that put Americans at even greater risk. As Congresswoman, I will fight to ensure the safety and security of the American people.</p>"

    "q1":"This deal is a disaster; it is flawed, and it poses a direct threat to American national security. This deal offers few, if any, provisions to stop Iran from developing nuclear weapons, and it is premised on the belief that a rogue state sponsor of terrorism can and should police themselves. Congressman Delaney even agreed that this was a bad deal for America, yet he stood on the floor of Congress and voted to approve it anyway. The next President and Congress should take steps, on day one, to reverse this deal, stop Iran from developing nuclear weapons, and place a higher priority on American national security. The Iran nuclear deal is just one of many dangerous foreign policy failures of the Obama Administration.</p>",
    "q2":"The first thing that we must do to protect the United States from ISIS is to ensure that our borders are secure and that terrorists are not, under any circumstance, entering our country. Our lack of border security and inept vetting processes are among our largest concerns in terms of national security. Before we can defeat ISIS abroad, we must ensure that we are keeping Americans safe at home. If we do not know who you are, where you are coming from, and why you are coming to America, then you should not be allowed entrance into our country.</p><p>Militarily, the United States must use every weapon in our arsenal to identify, target, and destroy ISIS. We have the greatest military and intelligence agency in the world. We must support them, allow them to operate, and coordinate with our allies so that we can stop the spread of ISIS.</p><p>Finally, the United States must rebuild our relationships in the Middle East. Throughout the Obama presidency, our foreign partners have lost respect for the United States and no longer trust that we have their backs. An apathetic approach to foreign policy is what led to the creation and rapid spread of ISIS in the first place. The United States must once again be respected as a global military power that is committed to preserving democracy and human rights in every corner of the globe.</p>",
    "q3":"While the levels of secrecy and lack of transparency surrounding the Trans-Pacific Partnership do cause me concern, I am generally supportive of free trade deals that benefit American businesses and protect American workers. Free trade deals create avenues for American businesses to sell their products in foreign markets, and they increase Americans' purchasing power. </p><p>Where free trade deals have failed in the past is that they have broken down trade barriers for American businesses, yet burdensome taxes and regulations remain. We must pursue trade policies that grow the American economy, but we also must make the United States the most attractive place in the world to do business. If we do both of these things, then American workers will be protected, and we will ignite economic growth in our country.</p>",
    "q4":"The Affordable Care Act isn't functioning, so the one thing I would do would be to repeal it. Families have been kicked off the health plans that they liked just to pay more for plans that are worse. Costs continue to skyrocket and the quality of health care remains stagnant. It is finally time for individuals on both sides of the aisle to admit that we disrupted one-sixth of our total economy for the President's health plan, yet we are objectively worse off. </p><p>If we want to be serious about healthcare reform, then we must create competition in the insurance marketplace. We must reassess the ways that doctors and hospitals are reimbursed, and consumers must be given more choices and better options so that they can decide what is best for them. We must expand healthcare savings accounts, provide incentives for businesses to insure their employees, and remove the barriers that make insurance so costly in the first place. </p><p>The Bernie Sanders/Hillary Clinton idea of healthcare just doesn't work. I will fight for patient-centered and market-focused healthcare reform in Congress.</p>",
    "q5":"Since Dodd-Frank was signed into law, almost one quarter of American banks have been wiped out -- nearly all of them have been small, community banks and credit unions, not the investment banks on Wall Street.. If the intention is to reduce Wall Street's influence, then the increased presence of federal regulations has had the opposite effect. </p><p>As a result, it is more difficult and more costly for small business owners and investors to obtain the necessary capital to start and grow their businesses. </p><p>Dodd-Frank hit the economy with billions of dollars in new regulatory costs, unduly burdened small and community banks, and made it more difficult for businesses and individuals to obtain the necessary capital to innovate, grow their companies, and invest in America's economy. We must repeal regulations like Dodd-Frank so that the government cannot continue to impose its bureaucratic will at the cost of American economic innovation. Measures to control Wall Street's appetite are dangerous when those same measures starve Main Street.</p>",
    "q6":"Barack Obama began his presidency by saying that he wanted to radically transform America. Unfortunately, he has. During his time in office, the United States has become less safe, less prosperous, less respected around the world, and less reliant on the Constitution. The saddest thing is that, through all of this, President Obama has not helped Americans -- he has blamed them for his own personal and policy failures. </p><p>When radical jihadis killed 14 in San Bernardino, he blamed America's infatuation with guns rather than his inability to secure our nation. When household incomes plummeted, he blamed the 1% rather than his job-killing taxes and regulations. When Ferguson and Baltimore rioted in the streets, he blamed lingering racism among white Americans, and as ISIS swept across the Middle East, he told us that our Islamophobia was their motivating factor. And as his Veterans Administration literally killed our nation's heroes, he blamed Fox News. </p><p>President Obama has accomplished his goal of radically transforming America, and he has done so by doing the things at which he is best -- campaigning, dividing, and blaming. His legacy will be defined by the millions of Americans that he has left less safe and worse off, by a nation that, eight years later, is still searching for the hope and change he promised.</p>",
    "q7":"I do not support an increase in the minimum wage and I do not support federally-mandated paid leave because until the government stops trying to impose its will on the American economy, those measures will do nothing to make a single American better off. We cannot continue to tax and regulate businesses then impose further costs on them when those taxes and regulations kill jobs and hold those businesses back. If we want to raise Americans' wages and allow workers to enjoy paid leave and other benefits, then we have to remove the economic barriers that are killing American businesses. We have to focus on the entire economic pie and how we can grow it for everyone instead of identifying individual pieces and attempting to slice them further. </p><p>We are doing a disservice to American workers by reducing our discussion of workforce issues to the minimum wage and paid leave. That sends the message that this is as good as it gets and that government action is the only catalyst for economic growth. In Congress, I will focus on ways to raise incomes and improve economic situations for ALL Americans by reducing taxes, cutting regulations, and ensuring that the federal government cannot continue to strangle the American economy.</p>",
    "q8":"The best way that Congress can reduce the toll of gun violence is to stop passing laws that make it harder for law-abiding Americans to purchase and own guns. Not a single gun control measure championed by President Obama would have stopped any of the mass shootings in America over the past several years. Instead, those measures have made it harder for Americans to defend themselves, their homes, and their families.</p><p>I am proud to be one of the most pro-gun legislators in Annapolis because I believe it is my duty to uphold the Constitution and ensure Marylanders have the right to protect themselves.</p>",
    "q9":"This process does need to be reformed, and I fully support Governor Hogan's efforts to do so in Maryland. Politicians should not be allowed to protect their careers or their parties based solely on where lines are drawn. This process should be handled by a nonpartisan commission on the state level, just as Governor Hogan has proposed.</p>",
    "q10":"I have a passion to serve -- that is what led me to join the Marine Corps and to run for the House of Delegates. Maryland's 6th District is in desperate need of a common-sense conservative that can go to Washington and fight for our needs. I am proud to be a conservative leader in Annapolis and to have fought for this nation in Afghanistan. Now, I feel that I must place my name on the ballot to continue the fight for lower taxes, less government, and more individual freedom.</p>"

    "q1":"I appreciate the Baltimore Sun's attentive use of the word \"intended.\" Perhaps there are good intentions behind the Iran nuclear deal, but here are the consequences. Iran will be flush with at least $100 billion with which to continue funding Hamas, Hezbollah, Fatah and Islamic Jihad. More money means more rocket attacks, suicide bombers and uprisings threatening Israel. This agreement almost guarantees a nuclear-arms race in the Middle East as Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Jordan, and Turkey will not stand idly by while Iran is free to lay the groundwork for developing nuclear capacity. The agreement allows Iran to continue development of Inter-Continental Ballistic Missiles which have one purpose: the delivery of nuclear warheads. Once they have ICBMs they will be able to reach the U.S. and this strike capability will be ten years or less from now. Meanwhile, Iran is becoming a regional superpower. In addition to lifting economic sanctions, the deal allows Iran access to advanced weapons technology that it does not currently have. Verification measures are slow and bureaucratic and give Iran wide latitude on inspection procedures. Recently, the U.S. has been reduced to praising Iran for not harming US Navy sailors who inadvertently ventured into Iranian territory. This was after they were humiliated with photos distributed across the world suggesting they might have been executed. The results and consequences are clear. It is a bad deal and I back the repeal of the Iran nuclear agreement.</p>",
    "q2":"The Administration must focus additional air power on eliminating ISIS-controlled oil infrastructure and supply chains because that is the primary source of funding for ISIS. We need to ensure that the rules of engagement allow the military to do its job. At home, the challenge is for Congress to conduct proper oversight of intelligence, law enforcement and homeland security. It is imperative that we \"connect the dots\" on identifying potential threats. A key recommendation of the 9/11 commission has been ignored over 10 years after its ground-breaking report on preventing future attacks was issued. More than 90 committees and subcommittees have some jurisdiction over the Department of Homeland Security, far more than the number of committees overseeing the Defense Department; Congress must streamline the DHS oversight process. Finally, I support Gov. Larry Hogan's position on suspending Syrian immigration to the U.S. unless and until security measures can be verified and the refugees properly vetted. I do not support incumbent Congressman John Delaney's position that somehow the U.S. can speed up and increase the number of Syrian immigrants to Maryland without causing a security breach. Syria is home to the headquarters of ISIS and it's foolish to believe terrorists will not attempt to pass themselves off as \"refugees\" in order to plot attacks here at home. On a related note, I also support bipartisan measures to improve the VISA program and amend the waiver process where people travel from countries that are a breeding ground for terrorist activities.</p>",
    "q3":"Trade deals in theory are a good deal for the U.S. provided we have a strong economy and they do not outsource jobs overseas. Nobody can say that now, so therefore I do not support the TPP. It is absurd that some who argue for an increase in the minimum wage have no problem sending jobs to sweat-shop factories in countries like Vietnam where factory workers blow a month's salary in one trip to a grocery store. The issue before us is improving economic conditions here at home before embarking on complicated trade agreements that only worsen our situation. We are in the worst economic \"recovery\" since World War II. Corporate inversions are encouraging iconic American companies to headquarter overseas. Fewer Americans are starting small businesses than at any time in our nation's history. Labor force participation rates are at the lowest levels since the 1970's. Welfare has not been reformed in 20 years, and the tax code rewards collecting benefits over working. An elementary school student struggling with basic math is not put in a high school calculus class because everyone knows they wouldn't be ready and it would actually worsen the situation. The political class is struggling with basic math, refusing to address basic priorities here at home. I want to suspend trade deals until Congress can demonstrate an ability to address basic American priorities and allow us to compete.</p>",
    "q4":"Obamacare is based on coercion, confusion, mandates and regulation. Well-paid employees of large companies do not feel the pain this inflicts on others, because they receive coverage under the old employer-based system that worked a lot better than Obamacare. Coercion is forcing people to buy health insurance or face a penalty. Confusion is rampant because it requires those who receive tax subsidies to properly anticipate their income each year or face IRS fines. It is also confusing because a benchmark plan offered one year may expire the next, once again wreaking havoc on individual tax returns. Mandates, the government dictating to insurance companies what coverage must be provided, are driving up rates, causing health insurers to end participation in federal and state exchanges and cancel policies to people who were fine with their plan the way it was. Regulation restricts coverage options by forbidding people to buy insurance across state lines. If Congress and a new President can't repeal the law outright, Obamacare can be marginally improved by allowing the private sector to operate federal and state web-based exchanges. We do not book airline flights on an FAA website and neither should we buy insurance from HHS or state government websites that will never work as well as those developed by the private sector. I am in favor of repealing and replacing Obamacare with a market-based system that puts doctors and patients in charge of healthcare, not government bureaucrats.</p>",
    "q5":"Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac must be fully privatized but they have been in government conservatorship since 2008. It makes no sense for taxpayer-subsidized organizations to provide an artificial market for home mortgages to Wall Street financial institutions, who in turn sell mortgage-backed securities to the public. The next time there is a housing crisis, count on Fannie and Freddie receiving another bailout upholding its \"business\" model of privatized gains and socialized losses. One area of regulation I do support is holding credit-rating agencies like Moody's and Standard and Poor's accountable for their role in the financial crisis. The vast majority of subprime mortgage bonds that were assigned AAA ratings before 2008 were downgraded to junk status. These companies have a built-in conflict of interest in which security issuers pay to have their financial vehicles rated. Dodd-Frank, on the other hand, has essentially halted new banks. There were only a few new banks created from 2011 through 2014. But before Dodd-Frank's enactment an average of well over 100 banks were created annually. Unless we want to do our banking at only a handful of large institutions, then we must understand Dodd-Frank's impact on small, community banks.</p>",
    "q6":"President Obama's greatest accomplishment was engaging young people to vote especially in 2008, but also in 2012. And he has occasionally shown bipartisan leadership on issues like criminal justice reform, working with the conservative Koch brothers to generate awareness of the need to overhaul the criminal code that threatens jail time for a range of minor offenses. President Obama's biggest failure directly related to Maryland is the Administration refusing to visit Baltimore in a timely manner after the riots. The Housing and Urban Development Secretary was missing in action and this was the department Lyndon Johnson charged with revitalizing America's great cities 50 years ago. The stimulus, Affordable Care Act (Obamacare), IRS targeting of conservative groups, the Veteran's Affairs scandal, the Fast and Furious scandal, and the response to Benghazi will go down in history as case studies in government ineptitude and obfuscation. Our foreign policy is a mess after years of emboldening our enemies and damaging relations with our allies. America is a blessed nation and we have an obligation to lead in the international community, and President Obama has failed in this regard. \"Leading from behind\" for the world's only superpower will go down in history as an epic failure. And our nation is suffering through the worst ever recovery from recession, with economic growth stagnant, job creation sluggish, new-business formation at a crawl, and over 90 million people out of the workforce. It's not a legacy to be proud of and much work needs to be done.</p>",
    "q7":"The best way to raise wages is through a strong economy, not through artificial mandates that reduce hiring levels. Raising the minimum wage makes some politicians feel good but studies show raising it to levels currently being discussed would destroy hundreds of thousands of jobs, and cause employers to cut back on hours for those employees they keep. Where's the compassion in that? Those who benefit from a minimum wage are political candidates who get more attendees at campaign rallies. No, the government should not require paid sick time and family leave. The private sector competes for employees with salary and benefits and smart ones will offer paid sick time and family leave as part of their compensation packages for productive employees they wish to retain.</p>",
    "q8":"I am a strong supporter of the Constitution and the Bill of Rights, which of course includes the Second Amendment. We cannot start tinkering with these liberties because once we do, it's a slippery slope for future Congresses and Presidents to enable the backsliding of America toward tyranny. I support measures to boost the federal background check system to prevent guns from getting into the hands of those with serious mental illness. Federal mental-health programs should be united under a single office to expand treatment and better enable commitment procedures to target the most severe cases.</p>",
    "q9":"Recently, Gov. Larry Hogan introduced legislation that will reform Maryland's corrupt redistricting process and bring us election integrity and transparency. Legislators fought hard in recent years to get our ridiculous Congressional boundaries overturned in a popular vote only to be undermined by state officials under Martin O'Malley who wrote misleading ballot language that nobody understood. Just how corrupt is Maryland's redistricting process? A nationally-recognized Geographic Information System firm says Maryland's 6th Congressional district is among the top 10 worst gerrymandered districts in the country. It cobbles together areas that have nothing to do with each other - from Cumberland to the Washington Beltway. The 6th district was designed by power broker politicians in Annapolis. So let's support the Governor's efforts at honest reforms focused on where this mess started – in Annapolis.</p>",
    "q10":"Weak economic growth of 2% or less reduces hiring levels and wages. The complicated and expensive tax code must be reformed and simplified. I will work to reduce the federal tax burden in Washington just as Gov. Larry Hogan is doing in Annapolis. Congress, however, is not part of the problem: it is the problem. My 10-point plan to reform Congress will end chaos and dysfunction so it is capable of achieving results for the American people, ranging from national security to healthcare, education and jobs.</p>"

    "q1":"In many respects, I view the JCPOA as a poorly negotiated deal. While it has some strengths – eliminating Iran's current nuclear program, materially restricting Iran's enrichment capabilities for 15 years, cutting off Iran's various paths to a nuclear weapon across the same time period, and providing greater inspections access - it is too short in duration and is weak on access to conventional weapons and ICBMs. Considering our leverage, we should have negotiated a better deal. In analyzing the Iran deal, I explored whether voting to reject the deal could have led to something better. But after considering that we had 'showed our hand' and that all of our partners were committed to this deal and were set to lift their sanctions, I came to the conclusion that this was unlikely. Therefore I ultimately voted for the deal which I viewed to be the lesser of two bad options. Now we must make sure that 1) Iran doesn't cheat and that they are held accountable if they do 2) we combat Iran's efforts to support terrorism and 3) we make sure that we stand with Israel and our allies against Iranian aggression. In January, I introduced legislation to levy sanctions against Iran on entities that transfer ballistic missiles or advanced conventional weapons to or from Iran. My legislation would broaden the reach of current sanctions. I introduced this legislation to ensure that we hold Iran accountable for violations of ballistic missile and advanced conventional weapons bans.</p>",
    "q2":"I take ISIS at their word, that they are singularly focused on their heinous agenda and will do everything they can to kill and terrorize Americans and our values. We must do more to take the fight to ISIS, starting with debating a new authorization of military force in Congress that outlines clear parameters and provides the President with bipartisan authorization to definitively defeat ISIS forever. I support additional air strikes against ISIS supporting allied nations from the region taking the fight to ISIS, strengthening our efforts to starve their financial assets and making sure that our intelligence agencies have the tools and resources they need to fight and destroy ISIS.</p>",
    "q3":"I supported giving President Obama the authority to negotiate the TPP because I believe that he would negotiate a deal that is good for workers, good for the environment and good for our economy. The TPP was only recently finalized and I am still reviewing the details of the agreement, which is thousands of pages long, to make sure that it is good for Maryland. To be clear, in principle I support the TPP and believe that President Obama has negotiated the most worker friendly and environmentally friendly trade agreement in history. The bottom line is that we already operate in a global economy and moving forward I want the United States setting the agenda, not China.</p><p>In analyzing Maryland's economy and trade policy, I think about the importance of agriculture across the state, strengthening and expanding the Port of Baltimore, and continuing to grow our intellectual capital industries. In my view the TPP is going to open new markets to Maryland farmers, bring new economic activity to the Port, and create opportunities for our bio, IT, and cyber industries. And right now, both rural Maryland and Baltimore are two parts of our state that need more economic development. On balance, trade and foreign investment already materially helps Maryland's economy and if you care about Maryland's economy you have to care about trade. According to the Department of Commerce, last year 59,000 Maryland jobs were supported by over $12 billion in exports. </p>",
    "q4":"Overall the Affordable Care Act has been good for the country. Thanks to the ACA more people have coverage, people with preexisting conditions can actually get coverage, young people can stay on their parents' plan longer, women can't be charged more simply because they're women, and health care costs are finally growing less than the rate of inflation – something that has not happened for decades and something that is incredibly important to the deficits and debt of the United States. I think that the ACA can be improved by removing the penalties it places on high-quality employer-provided plans and repealing the Medical Device Tax.</p>",
    "q5":"Absolutely - increased regulation and consumer and investor protections were needed and appropriate. The 2008 financial crisis was one of the most damaging economic downturns of the last century and one that seriously hurt working families and the middle class. As a result of the financial crisis 19 of the 20 largest financial firms in the United States either failed or required government funds. If that's not the backdrop for reform, I don't know what is. Thousands of families lost their homes, we were losing hundreds of thousands of jobs each month and the majority of the largest financial firms in the country were in danger of collapsing. It would have been unthinkable not to act. But our work isn't done. It's ridiculous that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is under daily attack from Congress and I have defended the CFPB on the Financial Services Committee. I have also authored housing finance reform legislation to save the 30-year mortgage and protect taxpayers from future bailouts. Finally, I have worked closely with President Obama on the new investor protections being led by the Department of Labor, which will prevent investors from getting bad advice due to a conflict of interest from their broker. This is a major problem that is especially hurting retirees and I was proud to stand with Senator Elizabeth Warren and the President when these new protections were announced last year.</p>",
    "q6":"Any analysis of President Obama's legacy has to include the fact that he was presented with one of the worst hands of any President, ever. The economy was reeling losing half a million jobs per month when he took office and we were still immersed in an ill-conceived war in Iraq, a war that ultimately cost Americans dearly in terms of lost lives and trillions of unpaid for expenditures. President Obama put the brakes on the financial crisis and led us out of the Great Recession. In fact, the United States has performed much better than any of our economic competitors. Second, he has led on climate change, which I view as a significant threat to our national security – something our military has confirmed by calling it a \"threat multiplier\" – and overall American economic prosperity. Third, the Affordable Care Act has given millions of Americans coverage they didn't have before and the President has led on LGBT rights. Finally, under his leadership we brought Osama bin Laden to justice. I still think we have real work to do to create good-paying jobs, address income inequality, and strengthen the middle class, starting with additional major infrastructure investments. I am disappointed that we did not use this sustained period of low interest rates to invest in infrastructure and rebuild our country and I have worked tirelessly to do that. Finally, I think the humanitarian crisis in Syria demanded more action from the United States.</p>",
    "q7":"Yes, I am a cosponsor of legislation to raise the minimum wage to $12 an hour and was the first state wide or federal elected official to call for an increase in the minimum wage in Maryland. I also strongly support paid family leave and sick time. No one should suffer financial hardship just because they get sick. It is important to remember, however, that raising the minimum wage – while obviously important when you consider that it has lagged inflation – is only one small step we need to take to raise wages. A national infrastructure plan, which I have obtained material bi-partisan support for, would do even more.</p>",
    "q8":"Congress should stop listening to interest groups and start listening to the vast majority of Americans who support commonsense gun safety measures. Congress should start with implementing universal background checks, closing the gun show loophole and preventing those people who are on the no fly list from being able to buy a gun. <P></p>We also need to expand mental health availability so that those suffering from mental illness can access care before they commit crimes, provide more resources to law enforcement and first responders who are charged with protecting our citizens, improve coordination between federal, state and local agencies and taking steps to address the pervasive glorification and acceptance of violence in our country. </p>",
    "q9":"I support using independent commissions to draw district lines. This is a national problem that requires a national solution and I have introduced legislation that includes redistricting reform, creating open primaries and making Election Day a holiday. I am not opposed to efforts to do redistricting reform at a state level if it is truly a bipartisan effort.</p>",

Additionally we currently have over 40 million Americans dependent on the Government for some sort of public assistance, such as food stamps, or welfare, and we also have the lowest workforce participation of able body American in more than 40 years.

However, as a licensed ACA professional, I know that there is still much work to be done. Two years following enactment of the ACA, premiums are rising, and the quality of coverage is declining. In addition, 29 million Americans remain without any coverage at all. I believe we need to expand coverage, ensure high quality coverage with lower, and truly affordable deductibles, and work towards a universal, single payer system though insurance industry regulation and government oversight.</p>",
    "q5":"I believe that the administration did not go far enough in its pursuit of justice against those responsible for the financial crisis. While some of the affected were among the wealthiest, the financial crisis destroyed the lifesavings and future plans of millions of working Americans. Those responsible should be indicted and prosecuted for their role. I do not believe that any organization is too big to fail.</p>",
    "q6":"President Obama's legacy is one of historic proportions. I am very proud Americans were able to overcome the darkest period of our past and elect an African American to the highest office in the land. We are the country of opportunity and our strength is in our diversity. President Obama has led us from the depths of a serious economic crisis and we can now boast an unemployment rate of only 4.9%. However, he has not fulfilled his promise of truly withdrawing the United States from military conflicts around the world, and Guantanamo Bay remains open, with prisoners whose home countries refuse to accept them, and who are still being held without charge. His landmark legislation, the Affordable Care Act, has provided millions of previously uninsured Americans with health insurance coverage, and forced insurance companies to provide coverage for those with pre-existing conditions, the people who need coverage the most. At the same time, the ACA has fallen short of its promise to be truly affordable, and the quality of the coverage has fallen as insurance companies adjust coverage to compensate for the loss in profits. We can and must do better.</p>",
    "q7":"I strongly support an increase in the federal minimum wage to $15/hour and I will do everything in my power to enact minimum wage legislation if elected. A living wage is a basic responsibility of a global economy. Therefore, as the world's largest economy, I believe we should provide paid family leave commensurate with the remainder of the advanced economies around the world so that all Americans are able to work without the worry that their employment and livelihood are in jeopardy because of a personal crisis. I believe in treating all employees humanely.</p>",
    "q8":"The most important thing we need to do is universally enforce the gun laws currently on the books. We need to close any loopholes, and require that anyone purchasing a gun, in any circumstances, be required to undergo a waiting period and background check.</p>",
    "q9":"Redistricting is a fundamental right of the state. However, the redistricting process as it currently stands, needs a complete overhaul. I owe an apology to the people of Maryland's 6th District for the cavalier manner in which they have been used in the redistricting process. Redistricting should not be used to guarantee political success, but rather to ensure that the citizens of a district be fairly represented in Congress. Redistricting should be determined based on population growth and common sense boundaries. As your Congressman, I will do everything in my power to restore the 6th District to its historical boundaries.</p>",
    "q10":"I'm running for Congress to restore the opportunity for a better life for residents of my district and country through progressive policies and ideals</p>"

We need a price cap on how much they can charge over the cost of making the medication. For example of a few medication. Harvoni for hepatitis c it cost to make it for the 3 months about $1450 and they sale it for over $90,000 with copay as much at $4,300 a month just the copay alon pays almost 3 times the cost of making them. </p><p>I'm all for term limits in congress and senate.

Philosophy, Political Theory, Theology, Literature and History became my heart's desire, so I delved into as many books as the M.S.U library could offer. I worked as a landscaper in the physical plant department of the university to help with tuition while often listening to the stories of everyday working people in the city and state. I must say that I did not finish my degree at Morgan, largely because I found myself homeless at the age of 25 in Baltimore city. Never-the-less it is while I was homeless on the streets that I received a \"real world\" education in regards to the plight of the people in Baltimore, Maryland, & the Nation.</p><p>Ever since then, I have had a fire for social justice & community activism. In Richmond VA, I worked for Service Employees International Union (SEIU) for the Raise Up for $15 movement for fast food workers as well as the Child Care Fight for $15 movement for those employed in taking care of other peoples children. When I returned to Baltimore after the riots I worked again as a field organizer for the Labor Union named Unite Here Local 7. It was an honor & privilege to work for a union that is truly in the \"trenches\" of community activism. It was as an organizer for UNHL7 that I realized the lack of jobs in the city of Baltimore is one primary cause for the cities ills. Let me make it clear: I believe in the working man/woman, the Union, and better paying jobs.</p>"

    "q1":"The long-standing, non-partisan and publicly-declared foreign policy commitment of the United States is that we will do whatever is required to prevent Iran from possessing nuclear weapons. Although I would have preferred even more stringent and comprehensive limitations upon Iran's ability to construct and deploy a nuclear weapon, some of our best nuclear scientists concluded that, without approval and implementation of the JCPOA, the current \"breakout time\" for Iran's ability to produce an operational nuclear weapon was only months. I concluded that the JCPOA significantly enhanced our ability to change that deadly timetable, both immediately and in the longer term. Iran was required to reduce the number of its centrifuges by two-thirds, cease production of weapons-grade plutonium, halt construction of a heavy-water reactor, get rid of 98 percent of its existing enriched uranium, and halt enrichment of uranium above 3.67 percent purity. That resolution to the immediate threat posed by Iran's nuclear program were compelling, as were the longer-term security capabilities gained by the intrusive nature of the inspections provided by the JCPOA and our nation's unilateral ability to \"snap back\" the whole range of sanctions in the event of any future Iranian noncompliance.</p>",
    "q2":"Consistent with national security considerations, I can publicly confirm my support for this broader vision. We must and will defeat ISIS, but only by sharing the fight with a broad coalition of allies (more than 60 at this time) can we prevent the United States from being drawn into another long war. Our current strategy includes an expanding commitment to cut off ISIS from its finances, stop the flow of foreign fighters, counter ISIS propaganda, join in airstrikes against ISIS military targets, build the capacity of allied fighters on the ground, and provide humanitarian assistance to innocent civilians who are being displaced and harmed.</p>",
    "q3":"No. Generally, I support free trade, but to achieve our national goals, free trade must also be fair and smart trade. Although we continue to review the proposed trade agreement, I am deeply concerned that the TPP would cost our nation jobs, would not adequately protect the environment, would not adequately ensure the safety of our imports, nor provide America's workers a more level playing field with respect to underpaid workers overseas.</p>",
    "q4":"I have long supported universal access to healthcare under a single-payer system based upon expansion of Medicare to all Americans at birth. Although I have strongly supported the Affordable Care Act as an important first step toward this goal, I was disappointed that we were unable to overcome opposition to a public option in the legislation.</p>",
    "q5":"There is little doubt that the financial crisis devastated the lives of most Americans – costing 9 million workers their jobs, driving 5 million families out of their homes, and wiping out more than $13 trillion in household wealth. I was proud to vote for the Dodd-Frank legislation, and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is adding significant protections for American families. However, we must be vigilant and continue to fight against efforts to weaken and delay the legislation's protections, at the same time limiting the ability of federally-insured institutions to engage in risky practices.</p>",
    "q6":"I was honored to lead President Obama's 2008 and 2012 presidential campaigns here in Maryland, and, on balance, I believe that history will evaluate his presidency as a great one. His leadership – often in the face of partisan political opposition — brought our nation back from the most devastating recession in our lifetime, saving millions of jobs, significantly expanded our access to healthcare, moderated our involvement in foreign military conflicts, moved us forward in protecting our environment, and, once again, gave us a President whom Americans can trust.</p>",
    "q7":"I have long supported an increase in the federal minimum wage to a level consistent with a living wage. I also support both paid sick time and family leave.</p>",
    "q8":"Gun violence has devastated the lives of tens of thousands of American families every year, including my own. Yet, conservative opposition has prevented us from taking the reasonable steps that would better protect us, including an expanded and more effective background check system and assuring that those with serious mental health issues do not have access to firearms. In the current and past sessions of Congress, I have been proud to be among those leading the fight to pass the Gun Trafficking Prevention Act of 2015 [H.R. 3455], which would directly address concerns by law enforcement officials who testified that a dedicated federal firearms trafficking statute would help them combat the flow of thousands of firearms to violent criminals, international drug cartels, and a host of other dangerous people. Our legislation would make firearms trafficking a federal crime and impose stronger penalties for \"straw purchasers\" who buy guns for convicted felons and others who are prohibited from buying guns on their own.</p>",
    "q9":"Within the limitation of one-person, one-vote, both our federal Constitution and tradition have left the manner in which congressional district lines are drawn up to the states, not the Congress. Both the courts and Maryland's voters approved the last redistricting lines. Maryland's Legislature currently is considering whether to change the process in which our congressional districts are drawn; and I should and will defer to their judgment.</p>",

The Iranians have been a constant destabilizing force in the region and will use the $100 million windfall to further support terrorist organizations such as Hezbollah. In addition, Iran has indicated that it intends to destroy Israel. Providing them with an open path to nuclear armament in 15 years is not only an existential threat to Israel, but will lead to an arms race in with Saudi Arabia and other Gulf states.</p>",
    "q2":"Tackling ISIS requires a comprehensive, long term and multifaceted approach. First, we need to use air power to degrade their forces and limit their ability to maneuver in Syria and Iraq. Second, we need to proactively engage them with air power in other areas. They are currently using the ungoverned areas in Libya to build their forces. We cannot allow them to establish a beach head there. Third, we need to resolve the war in Syria in order to limit the chaos under which they propagate. Fourth, we need to do a better job limiting their ability to create revenue through oil sales. Fifth, we need to further clamp down on their ability to move money across international borders. Sixth, we need to address the underlying political grievances that have helped give rise to ISIS. Seventh, we need to pressure Saudi Arabia to drop their support for radical madrassas that foster ISIS ideology. Eigth, we need to pressure Pakistan to stop supporting radical Sunni organizations such as ISIS and Al Qaeda as levers in their conflict with India. Ninth, we need continue to work on countering the narrative in the media and on social media that supports ISIS.

Second, the TPP is critical for our national pivot towards Asia and a deeper economic engagement with countries that can balance China. Third, I support the strict standards in TPP on environmental and labor issues. I don't think you can generalize about whether trade deals as whole are good for the U.S. They key issue is ensuring strong environmental and employee protections. The TPP requires member countries institute minimum wages and allow workers to form unions. It also addresses environmental issues such as overfishing and illegal logging. While not a perfect agreement, it is the best we can get with the countries involved.</p>",
    "q4":"I would eliminate the family affordability \"glitch\" whereby if a person is covered at work, but that coverage is unaffordable, they are not eligible for the subsidized coverage.</p>",
    "q5":"I strongly support Dodd-Frank and believe that it began the process of more appropriate regulation of the financial services industry. However, more needs to be done. First, I support creating a fiduciary standard for loan brokers. Washington and California have had success with these models. Mortgage and student loan brokers should be required to disclose potential conflicts of interest. Second, I would immediately push to reinstitute Glass-Steagall in order to separate commercial banking from investment banking. The 1999 repeal of Glass-Steagall and the resulting conflicts of interests were a key factor in exacerbating the financial crisis. Third, I will push to increase funding for regulatory oversight of the banks. The Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodities Futures Trading Commission and are vastly underfunded for their job requirements.</p>",
    "q6":"Generally, I think the President has done a good job in domestic affairs considering his unyielding Republican opposition in Congress. The Affordable Care Act is a great success and has provided health insurance for millions of Americans. The President has presided over a sustained period of economic and job growth. Interest rates and unemployment remain remarkably low. I also applaud his leadership on climate change in the Paris COP21 agreement. I think foreign policy has been a relative failure. From the Iran deal to the proliferation of ISIS, the President has failed to engage in policies that protect American interests. North Korea continues to proliferate nuclear weapons, and Russia and China are seemingly acting unchecked.</p>",
    "q7":"Yes, I support an increase in the federal minimum wage. It should phased in over the next three years to $15 an hour. The federal government should provide both paid sick time and paid family and medical leave. My national family policy, the centerpiece of my campaign, combines 6 months of paid parental leave and a choice of up to $10,000 of child care support or up to a $10,000 tax credit for a spouse who gives up his or her job to care for his or her child. What is needed is a major national family policy and not merely the passage of some paid parental leave. If a modest paid leave bill is passed, this might lead people to declare victory put aside the topic of raising children. The chief challenge young, middle class families face is caring for their children in the first five years of a child's life. Paid family leave is just the beginning of the problem. Dwight Eisenhower used to say, \"If I can't solve a problem I make it bigger.\" He didn't invade Normandy five beaches five weeks at a time. No, he did it all at once: D-Day. We need a D-Day national family policy which includes paid leave, child care, and tax-credits for stay at home parents, and it must include LGBT families also. The policy must have something for everyone -- liberals, moderates, conservatives, all family styles.</p>",
    "q8":"First, I support closing the gun show loophole. Every purchase should require a universal background check. Second, I support an outright ban on civilian purchase and ownership of automatic and semi-automatic weapons. Third, I support the banning of firearm and ammunition sales over the internet. Fourth, I support a ban on high capacity ammunition magazines. Fifth, I support a national permit to purchase policy that would require a permit prior to purchasing a firearm. Finally, I support repeal of the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act, which shields gun manufacturers from liability litigation.</p>",
    "q9":"I support universal redistricting reform that would shift the authority for redistricting from state legislatures to bi-partisan commissions run at the state level.</p>",
    "q10":"Our Congressional system is broken. I'm running as a post-partisan candidate who wants to change the dialogue in Washington. I have been working for years on several issues that are critical for working families. My family policy advocates for working families with a choice of paid leave and child care support or paid leave and a tax credit for a stay at home parent. I am also concerned about the neglected voters in the 8th district. The other candidates in the race are primarily focused on Montgomery County and its issues. I am the one candidate in the race who is also focusing on the needs of voters in Frederick and Carroll Counties.</p>"

The Iran Agreement must now be vigorously enforced to ensure that Iran can never develop a nuclear weapon.</p>",
    "q2":"The United States must continue to fight terrorism across the globe and protect against the threat from ISIS. We must continue to work in concert in allies, applying economic pressure to terrorist organizations and nations that support terrorism, and work for diplomatic and political solutions to the regions woes. We need to keep up the airstrikes and provide additional aid to the opposition in Syria and find safe havens for Syrian refugees. Finally, we must invest educating people worldwide about the ideological distinctions between democracies like the United States and groups such as ISIS. I do not support putting troops on the ground in Syria because I am afraid we will just put ourselves in a quagmire at the expense of American lives.</p>",
    "q3":"I am opposed to the Trans-Pacific Partnership because it does not adequately address labor rights and environmental concerns. There are an estimated 4 million unfilled jobs in America and our priority should to be to first use our resources to fill those jobs, through education and training programs and worker retraining efforts, before entering into trade agreements. Only then will we be able to compete in the markets that the TPP attempts to open up. On the environment side, we must combat climate disruption as aggressively abroad as we do at home. Economic development and environmental protection are not mutually exclusive and we must be stewards of the earth here and abroad. I am not against free trade and it is a necessary part of the global economy but recent trade deals have not delivered on their economic promise, have harmed the American worker and have not furthered our environmental efforts.</p>",
    "q4":"I support the Affordable Care Act and believe that, as a general matter, it is working. Tens of millions American now have health insurance and many of them for the first time. Many of the enrollment issues in original sign up process have been addressed. One things that we may improve upon is transparency in pricing. We need to greatly expand the information available to health care consumers. People should be able to compare data on costs of services and quality of outcomes. Improved transparency will result in better and more efficient care as patients choose health care providers based on cost and performance.</p>",
    "q5":"I support the Dodd-Frank legislation, the creation of the Consumer Protection Financial Bureau and other steps that have been taken by Congress and the Administration to address the financial crisis, We must rein in banks' risky trading, regulate the derivatives market and set new standards for Wall Street pay. I believe that the key to making the regulations work is in funding and enforcement. The Securities and Exchange Commission, Commodities Futures Trading Commission and other federal enforcement agencies must fully enforce the laws and those found in violation of the law must be prosecuted. Congress must do its part by providing adequate funding for these law enforcement agencies to monitor and investigate Wall Street actions. The public lacks confidence that the nation's financial system acts in the public interest.</p>",
    "q6":"I think the centerpiece of President Obama's legacy is the Affordable Care Act or \"Obamacare\". We fought for decades for national health care reform and President Obama got it done. I am proud to have fought the insurance industry in Maryland and passed a law that forced HMOs to let patients see the doctor of their choice. Many of the health care reforms that I sponsored and fought for in the state were precursors to the key provisions of the Affordable Care Act. </p><p>I also think that an important legacy of President Obama is the groundbreaking nature of his presidency. The very fact that we have an African American president opens doors and gives hope to people of color across America. His presidency overcame an historical hurdle on our nation's arc from slavery to now. As the first Indian American ever elected to a state legislature in American History I take great pride in the importance that my barrier breaking political career has had on future leaders and generations. I am extremely proud to have opened doors for a number of Indian American and Asian American leaders in politics and government and my candidacy for Congress has been endorsed by the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus Leadership PAC. While the vitriolic opposition to President Obama has, unfortunately, reminded us of how far we still have to go, his presidency is a great symbol that the American Dream is open to every American, no matter the color of their skin.</p>",
    "q7":"I support the \"Fight for 15\", a nationwide effort to raise the minimum wage to $15, and am proud to have been endorsed by UNITEHERE International Union in my race for Congress. American workers are working harder everyday for less and less salary and benefits. Working families are not able to provide for their children as need be and that has implications for public health, education and American competitiveness. An increase in the minimum wage to $15 would boost our economy because all of these increased wages would be put back in the economy in the form of purchased goods and services. The federal government should also require paid sick time and family leave. Too often, working people are faced with the prospect of losing their job to take care of their kids or loved ones.</p>",
    "q8":"We need to enact common sense gun violence prevention laws. I am proud of my record of standing up to the NRA and as House Majority Leader I led the fight to pass one of the strongest gun laws in the nation. However, we can do better and I am supporting legislation that would keep guns off of college campuses and out of the hands of convicted abusers and suspected terrorists. Congress needs to enact comprehensive federal gun legislation that would include banning assault weapons and high-capacity magazines, instituting universal background checks with appropriate waiting periods, closing gun show loopholes, requiring the latest in gun safety technology and holding gun manufacturers accountable. The majority of Americans support laws to prevent gun violence. In Congress, as I have done in Maryland, I will work to bring people together - faith leaders, sensible gun owners, those on the other side of the aisle - to get something done on gun violence prevention.</p>",
    "q9":"The American people deserve a congressional redistricting process free of partisan politics and it must be reformed at the national level. Our Congressional districts are gerrymandered to protect incumbent Members of Congress and to strengthen the party in power in that particular state. It may be possible for Maryland to lead on redistricting reform if it is joined by neighboring states such as Virginia and Pennsylvania. Unfortunately, If Maryland makes a change alone it would only exacerbate the problem, Over a million more Americans voted for Democrats in U.S. House races than Republicans but the Republicans are in the majority in the House because they controlled redistricting in states such as Texas and Florida. We need national redistricting reform and I will work for that in Congress.</p>",
    "q10":"I have the most legislative experience in fighting for progressive change, taking on the big interests and getting things done for Marylanders. I overcame many obstacles to become the first Indian American elected to a state legislature in American History and to rise to leadership posts in the state legislature. I served as Chairman of the Montgomery County House Delegation, Democratic Majority Leader for 12 years, and now am Chairman of the House Environment and Transportation Committee. </p><p>I have taken on the insurance industry, the NRA and the oil and gas industry to pass health care reform, gun safety legislation and a moratorium on fracking. In Congress I will be the first Asian American from Maryland and will continue to fight for middle class families, our environment and to make our communities safe.</p>"

More people of Iranian origin now live in the United States than anywhere else in the world, other than in Iran, itself. Ties between Iranians, and their Iranian-American cousins are numerous, and presumably play some role in influencing young Iranians - especially in urban areas - towards seeing America in a positive light.</p><p>The upshot is an almost schizophrenic combination of \"Death To American\" chanters, sharing the country with increasingly numerous younger Iranians inclined to admire the USA.</p><p>Like everyone else, Iranians want to be respected. We should consider this when weighing the wisdom of making public criticism of the current theocratic regime. At the same time, history suggests we not take lightly Iranian threats expressed against American and Israel.</p><p>A mixture of distrust, skepticism, extreme vigilance against cheating, together with avoidance of gratuitous public criticism and insult, may buy us time until a younger, more America-friendly generation finally holds sway over the haters in Iran.</p>",

The insertion of western ground forces would \"fulfill\" an apocalyptic narrative inspiring ISIS' recruits, and so should occur reluctantly, if ever.</p><p>The fight belongs, first and foremost to the residents of the areas most affected. The Kurds, and Iraqis will likely require considerable financial aid from Saudi Arabia, to maintain or expand their offensives on ISIS, now that the depressed price of oil is devastating their overly-oil-dependent national budgets.</p><p>ISIS must be seen as a loser, in order to diminish its ability to recruit.</p>",

That's unacceptable. Who should lead the charge to fix this? Those in the HealthCare industry who are willing to acknowledge a fix is needed.</p><p>Any other \"fix\" imposed externally, will meet massive resistance. We should use the power of shaming, by asking repeatedly and often of the healthcare industry, \"Why do we pay 2-5 times more in American for healthcare?\" And, then, after the shaming, we should ask the smart and talented Doctors and Nurses and Patients, to help us fix problem.

Iran is a danger to Israel and its recent aggression in capturing our sailors and parading them in humiliation on TV was an outrage, as was its recent test of a missile, and were in violation of international law and the recent deal negotiated by Secretary of State John Kerry. Iran cannot be trusted and must be vigilantly opposed in its attempt to obtain a nuclear bomb and we should work side by side with the State of Israel and lead our other allies to ensure that never happens.</p>",
    "q2":"We must have a vigorous defense of the homeland by pausing any refugees or persons from ISIS controlled or embattled areas from entering this country such as occurred in San Bernadino until the director of the FBI can certify that our vetting process of the refugees is secure and will not place our country in peril. Second, we should greatly increase air strikes against ISIS targets of every capacity including supplies, headquarters and government, and work together with our allies to ensure ISIS is destroyed.</p>",
    "q3":"I strongly support free trade and believe that free trade brings economic growth, jobs and prosperity to millions of Americans. The need for a fair TPP is real. Yet, the TPP as it came down was a deal that in the end included two things that were an example of what Americans on both sides of the isle hate in our politics. First, a leaked immigration measure that would impact our immigration law without a vote in Congress. Second, the re-authorization of the Export-Import Bank, which is one of the worst examples of corporate welfare and misuse of our tax dollars. </p><p>Free trade deals are important and good whenever they protect American interests and do not unfairly cede authority to the World Trade Organization (WTO), or give us a bad deal in trading with other nations.</p>",
    "q4":"I would repeal the ACA. The average deductible for a plan with a payment most Americans would be stuck with is anywhere from $5000 to $11,000. That is not affordable. The tax penalty on those who don't purchase the insurance they cannot afford only makes it impossible for taxpaying citizens to make ends meet. I wold work to create tax credit incentives, not penalties, for purchasing insurance or for having private health care sharing or savings plans in place. This reduces the financial stress on the American taxpayer while encouraging real solutions to healthcare coverage.</p>",
    "q5":"We must repeal Dodd-Frank because it does not prevent future bank bailouts, but instead makes banks subject to micromanaging regulators. This has put thousands of small, local banks out of business. Reasonable regulations are needed for ensuring risk protection and to protect people from predatory lending, but Dodd-Frank is harming our economy and allowing little more than big government and big banks to take over more than one fifth of the US economy's GDP.</p>",

His recent humble and reflective speech at the 2016 National Prayer Breakfast doesn't seem to reflect the apparent lawless nature of his issuance of unilateral executive orders which the federal courts have held in several occasions to be unconstitutional.</p>",
    "q7":"No, increasing the wage mandate will reduce jobs and that will harm the working folks that are seeking to get started in entry level positions. In Maryland, it is easier and more profitable to get paid full-time for welfare, rather than to work. Mandating welfare to work should instead be enhanced by economic mobility and eliminating the corporate income tax which drives businesses out of our state and out of our country.</p><p>As a parent just now expecting a baby with my wife, I understand the need for economic mobility and income stability. However, the path for that is not through more mandates on businesses which cannot function without workers who show up and perform their jobs. The federal government should not require pay for workers who cannot show up and do the job. This would be both unfair and disastrous to our economy. Instead, government should create tax credit incentives to businesses who voluntarily provide pay incentives to employees who perform well but need time off to have a baby or meet a family need because of sickness. Family leave is already the law and tasking employers with not only holding the job open but also giving paid salaries during that time without a tax incentive is nothing more than opening the door for societal disaster. The federal government is currently on a 1 year or more backlog of Social Security Disability cases because we are out of money. We cannot expect employers to carry a similar burden.</p>",
    "q8":"Today the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit held that Maryland's gun ban enacted under Governor O'Malley impacts our fundamental constitutional rights such that it triggers the Court's highest constitutional test requiring strict scrutiny. This is important because to reduce gun violence we must not infringe upon the right to stop gun violence. The only way to stop a criminal with a gun is a good person with a gun. Congress should ensure that every executive action taken by the President regarding the right to keep and bear arms, and every judicial action by the courts improperly burdening and impacting that right, are rescinded. I will always fight for our right to defend against gun violence with the right to keep and bear arms.</p>",
    "q9":"Yes it does, as the current lines are clearly gerrymandering at its worst. I support the state's right to fairly resolve this issue and I believe Governor Hogan's plan should be passed and implemented by the Maryland General Assembly. The federal courts are a last resort, but are at times necessary when gridlock at the state level advances injustice.</p>",
    "q10":"Like the upcoming Olympics this year, to shine forth a torch of hope for the people of the 8th Congressional District that the issues of security, freedom, financial and health stability and our individual rights as Americans will be fought for, protected and secured if I am elected as their Member of Congress.</p>"

Ultimately this deal ensures that there isn't a war with Iran in the near future. If there happened to be a war, it would ensure that Iran wouldn't be able to develop a Nuclear weapon within a year time frame, giving us time to counter their efforts. </p><p>Overall, the deal ensures that tensions are normalized for the next 15 years, giving the U.S. opportunities to stabilize the region, as well as to reinforce further peace talks.</p>",
    "q2":"Let's keep in mind that a strategy is an idea or set of ideas which are intended to accomplish specific objectives, through the use of tools or instruments of power and influence. First, we should set an end-state, which is the destruction of ISIS and their allies, with the ultimate goal of achieving regional peace in the Middle East and North Africa. </p><p>Next, we should train enemies of ISIS in the region, providing guidance and coordination support (not weapons). We should empower our allies in the region to contain ISIS militarily, economically, physically, and ideologically, forcing them to act overly aggressive and into battles that we have preordained. We should support the forming a coalition of forces to protect safe zones, and civilians who are fleeing ISIS aggression, and with the coalition we should thwart ISIS activities. We must create a network of informants who would update leaders in the area on ISIS activities. We should then stop them from raising funds from oil and trade, isolating any nations who negotiate with them or support them in any way. </p><p>We should use our National influence in Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Jordan, Kuwait, and the UAE to further ISIS's destruction. Ultimately by empowering our allies in the region, we ensure that American lives are not lost. If we are successful our allies in the region will be proud of their efforts, and the U.S. will maintain regional presence, while limiting boots on the groups and financial burden.</p>",
    "q3":"I do not in any way support the TPP. The TPP will use an instrument called Investor-state dispute settlement (ISDS) to limit the powers that governments have over laws and regulations, allowing multinational corporations to erode laws created for protecting the public. The TPP will cause a loss in jobs in America, intellectual property rights will be threatened. Freedom of expression, due process, and innovation will be challenged. </p><p>Although politicians may believe that their trade deals and policies have helped our nation, it has only caused our government to institute more economic control measures, and has caused harm to our partner nations. Our trade agreements are typically politically expedient, guided by short term gain without long term reckoning. Our trade agreements rely far too much on corporations, lobbyist, and special interest inputs, and doesn't do justice to what American's desire. </p><p>The definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting a different outcome, and at present the American Politicians continue to involved themselves in actions that are not conducive to citizen approval. Today, the Real Clear Politics poll on American Congress is at 13.3%. If I were an employer and I only approved an employee 13% of the time I would reform or release said employee from that position. </p><p>Although I recognize the subtle strategy of economic empowerment over emerging economies, the upcoming trade deals erode American sovereignty. </p><p>In short, our \"free\" trade deals have unforeseen consequences not considered by short term gain politicians.</p>",
    "q4":"IF Obamacare is going to stay, we are going to have to change it in order to make it work for Americans. The very first thing that needs to change is the individual mandate penalties for not having insurance. If an American chooses not to invest in health insurance, for whatever reason, they should not be charged a penalty for doing so. This law is insulting to freedom of choice, and reflects the egregious notion that the government is the father of the citizens, instead of being by and for the people. </p><p>Obamacare was a step into the future that many Americans desire, however it is mainly a Health Insurance program and does little to offer Americans a choice in care. </p><p>In order to further improve the Affordable Care Act we should allow alternative treatments into our healthcare system, so people who disagree with invasive and harmful treatments are covered when they seek holistic and healthy alternatives. These ideas that I am speaking about are medicinal marijuana treatments, eastern medical treatments, diet and fitness treatments, alternative cancer treatments (Gerson therapy, Alkaline diets and plant based treatments, and other natural cancer treatments). If Americans desire universal health care coverage, we also deserve a wider amount of choices that fit into our lifestyles. Everyone doesn't agree with destructive treatments to solve destructive illnesses.</p>",
    "q5":"The short answer to this question is a resounding no. The Dodd-Frank Act does not to much to stop corruption in the political process, and only created more regulations harming small businesses and local banking institutions, further consolidating financial power in the hands of the wealthy. </p><p>As long as politicians are able to receive money from lobbyist and wall street, our citizens will continue to be pawns in the financial games played by wall street. To do this I would support the \"Anti-Corruption Act\" , which seeks to end corruption in politics, to empower the American public, and created more transparency in political financing.</p>",
    "q6":"President Obama opened the door for groups of people that feel disconnected from the political process, allowing my generation to believe that we have a voice and that there is hope in change, not only America, but the World. The President gives the African American population a glimpse of what a man of color in offices of authority could look like, and helps the youth realize that they are not stuck in poverty.</p><p>President Obama is intensely magnetic, and motivated the disenfranchised to get involved in the political process. Although the country has faced copious challenges in recent years, his smooth conversational methods continue to keep aggravated Americans patiently waiting for governmental improvement. </p><p>Although I respect President Obama, I am horrified that our country is still in disrepair. I am awestruck that ISIS and Boko Haram are still threats to world peace, and I am equally frustrated that the Israeli-Palestinian conflict continues to produce death and destruction. I feel that American dominance and power have been weakened, and that the American dream has sunk to debt based materialistic society. I don't blame the President for these outcomes, but I am convinced that he could have done more to further peace and justice. </p><p>Speaking of Justice, I find it reprehensible that African Americans continue to be targeted by the Drug War, profitable prisons, and gross injustice all across the Nation. Meetings, speeches, and heart felt conversations are not enough to compensate the lives lost due to inequality.</p>",
    "q7":"Our national economy is in shambles, and it is primarily due to the control that the federal reserve has on the system, the creation of predatory laws against the people, and the lack of confidence & trust that Americans have toward one another. If we want to improve our economy we must foster powerful relationships between people, and we must create more opportunity for small businesses. </p><p>At current price levels Americans, myself included, find it extremely difficult to live on work wages. I am in favor of a minimum wage increase up to $12 an hour, but I recognize that this is only a temporary solution. If we continue to use the \"increase the minimum wage\" logic, we will continue to chase the problem instead of finding a solution. If we only try to solve problems after they have become mountains, we may not survive any economic hardship. Our minimum wage increases could spell disaster for us in the long run, and will only need to increase further and further to keep up with cost of commodities and inflation. </p><p>We must come together as a nation to solve the monumental task of reforming all aspects of our materialism, indebtedness, and economic slavery to financial interest.</p><p>The federal government should encourage competition between companies, and of those competitive facets include sick time and family leave. The government should require a minimum amount of sick time and family leave time, but should also recommend a higher level for employeers.</p>",
    "q8":"As a military veteran and gun enthusiast I believe that we need to protect the 2nd amendment in order to allow American citizens a way to protect their family and property. I pray that a day never comes where we need to protect our nation from foreign adversaries, and having access to weapons for responsible handlers will be a back up in that situation. </p><p>Congress does however need to introduce training standards for those that want to legally obtain weapons, and they must be able to pass a weapons proficiency and handling test. This would ensure that Americans who legally obtain fire arms are capable and respectful of firearm power, while increasing the confidence of communities. With this proposition I think it is wise to offer free training and a requalification on a 5 year basis. This will also give non-weapons owners a way to educate themselves on firearm safety. </p><p>All of these measures would not only increase proficiency of weapons handlers, it will increase safety, jobs, and overall confidence in those who have weapons. </p><p>At the State level, we should pass gun reforms that are conducive to the states' citizens. The Congress should provide suggestions and recommendations for laws, but the individual states are best able to meet the needs of their citizens. </p><p>These measures would be a deterrent for criminals, would give us oversight on those incapable of handling the responsibility to handling weapons, and would provide clear pathways to gun purchasing and training.</p>",
    "q9":"Yes. The redistricting of our states should continue to be done by the states, who choose the federal representation, however the redistricting should be completed by a redistricting commission and approved by the state legislators and governor. The redistricting should be done in a non-partisan and federally protected way, ensuring that lines are not draw for political party surety. We need to limit Gerrymandering and create a simple way for citizens to challenge how their districts are drawn.</p>",
    "q10":"I am running for Congress because I believe that the United States, as well as the Great State of Maryland need a new political direction. I strongly feel that corruption, injustice, large money interest, and globally destructive forces are controlling our political system. It is my intent to inspire the American youth to prepare themselves for future leadership, to motivate capable and educated leaders of generation Y to begin building the future for our children, and to empower the American voter by providing them representation that they deserve.</p><p>I am running for Congress because I swore an oath to this Nation that I would protect it against all enemies, foreign and domestic, and I am seeing corruption, injustice, and oppression of the middle class citizens as the enemy. If I were to stand by silently and not run for Congress this year, I would be failing to hold to my commitment of oath to each one of you, and to myself. I would not be able to look at myself in the mirror knowing that I did not do all that I could to make the this world a better place.</p>"

    "q1":"I strongly support the agreement between Iran and six international powers signed on July 14 as the best way to prevent an Iranian nuclear weapon and avoid a war with Iran. The Iran Deal is yet another historic achievement showing that diplomacy works to solve the most intractable international problems. This agreement is proof that international negotiations can prevent the further spread of nuclear weapons. These weapons would not stop terrorism, civil wars, climate change, or cyber-attacks. The more countries that see nuclear weapons are useless in the 21st century, the better for international peace and security. I will work to ensure that Congress will stop any further attempts to undermine the agreement. We must not waste time and taxpayer money in futile opposition to the Iran Nuclear Deal. Instead let's join together and celebrate this historic progress on making the world a safer place. As a Board Member of WAND (Women's Action for New Directions ) which has endorsed my candidacy, I will continue to actively work with the Women Legislators' Lobby (WiLL) to seek peaceful, diplomatic solutions to the conflicts in the Middle East.</p>",
    "q2":"Despite our rhetoric and expression of good intentions, U.S. involvement in thousand-year-old middle east conflicts has proved disastrous. It appears that the U.S. has no \"real friends\", and has been on different sides at one time or another. This strategy is simply bankrupting our nation and often aggravating or prolonging the conflicts. Syrian refugees are flooding into Europe, with thousands dying during their long journeys. U.S.- trained Iraqi and Syrian fighters are cutting, running and allowing American-furnished weapons to fall into the hands of the enemies. The Russian government is supplying aid to the Syrian government against ISIS — positioning Putin as the region's leader in the war against Islamic terror. With the American-supported Iraqi government teetering on collapse, Iran's influence in the region continues to grow.</p><p>I believe that the United States must join together with a multinational coalition to develop a stronger, collective strategy to contain and eliminate the destructive forces of ISIS. Multinational coalitions working together through joint forces, common interests, tough negotiations and strong leadership are the right way to seek global peace and security. Continuing to promote strategies based on war and destruction are no longer an option. The American people understand that seeking peace multinationally and collaboratively through diplomacy is the first way to solve a crisis.</p>",
    "q3":"No, I do not support the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP). When in Congress, I pledge to stop the U.S. from joining this and any future free-trade agreements that send U.S. jobs overseas, violate our environmental and labor laws while granting super powers to international corporations. The TPP is a super-treaty which overrides the sovereignty of nations by giving that power to large corporations. As a native of El Salvador, I have seen first hand the extraordinary damage caused by the Central American Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA) which granted a major Canadian gold-mining corporations powers to contaminate 70% of the country's drinking water, violate environmental protections, and then sue the government under fraudulent contracts signed by prior corrupt officials. The TPP is simply \"CAFTA on Steroids\"! It gives multinational corporations and private investors the right to sue nations in private tribunals which can overturn environmental, labor, or any other laws that limit profit, awarding taxpayer funded damages. Millions of good-paying jobs could be shipped to low-wage nations, damaging working conditions globally and increasing unemployment. According to trade experts, the TPP would: expand pharmaceutical monopoly protections and decrease access to affordable medications; limit food GMO labeling and allow importing goods that do not meet US safe standards; institute SOPA, PIPA, and CISPA-like regulations and Internet measures which restrict our right to free speech; roll back Wall Street regulations, and prohibit bans on risky financial services; encourage the privatization of lands and natural resources in areas where indigenous people live.</p>",
    "q4":"To improve functioning of the ACA and contain overall health costs, I would expand coverage to more low-income individuals living in states, e.g.VA, which do not cover individuals and families living just above federal poverty guidelines, and to qualifying childless adults. I would also co-sponsor legislation to repeal of the so-called Cadillac tax on health benefits that exceed currently limits established by the ACA – originally intended to be applied to employers offering plans with higher annual costs ($10,200 for individuals and $27,500 for a family.) Because the tax will take effect in 2018, the next Congress must address the serious unanticipated consequences and the negative impact of a \"Cadillac tax\" on many employer health benefit plans. Due to the on-going increases in the cost of health care, the 40% tax will be applied to many plans that exceed these established limits. Although the tax intent was to discourage employers from offering overly generous plans allowing procedures that are often considered unnecessary and expensive, if the 40% tax is not repealed or amended before 2018, it will negatively impact too many employer and employees with higher than average costs of health benefit plans. Because the tax is intended to help pay for other portions of the ACA, repeal of the Cadillac tax must be carefully crafted as it could have a serious impact on the overall cost balance for providing broad access to health insurance to a greater number of individuals and families throughout the nation.</p>",
    "q5":"No, these steps are not enough! The Dodd-Frank reforms are not enough as major banks continue to take on too much risk and still pose a threat to the overall economy by remaining \"too big to fail.\" As we experienced during the the recent financial crisis, the melt-down of the big banks and big insurance companies had devastating effects on millions of Americans. I fully agree with the recent observations and recommendations made by Neel Kashkari, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, who argues that major reforms are still needed to prevent such a meltdown from ever occurring again. More needs to be done, such as breaking up the banks into small entities; increasing regulations, oversight, and accountability for its investments and practices; requiring big banks to hold much more capital on reserve, and to provide for greater liquidity. He also proposes a tax on leverage to reduce risk. Finally, I believe that we have to return to the provisions of Glass-Steagall that required a true separation of investment banking from more traditional customer-oriented deposits and lending banking functions.</p>",
    "q6":"President Obama's legacy, though truly historic from its very start, has been limited by his inability to work with an extremely, dysfunctional Republican Congress during most of his eight years in office. Much of what he hoped to accomplish simply has been met by an immovable brick wall of right-wing opposition!! His greatest accomplishment in my opinion, passage of the Affordable Care Act, came early during his tenure. However, his inability to deliver on his promise to end the war in Afghanistan and bring back the troops will continue to be viewed as \"failures\" of his administration. With regard to immigration reform--another early promise-- his legacy is quite \"mixed\". His failure to gain passage of immigration reform legislation early during his tenure has continued to be a long-lasting and negative mark on his record. Even though he later championed reforms that benefited thousands of \"Dreamers\", he still is considered by many as \"the Deporter-in-chief\" and the person responsible for breaking up innocent, hard working families. His inability to control and reign-in the inhumane practices of his own Department of Homeland Security and especially ICE employees, continue to negate his lofty rhetorical expressions of admiration and support for the hard working immigrant. Furthermore, his total lack of understanding the humanitarian dimensions of the plight of hundreds of unaccompanied Central American children escaping violence and seeking refuge in the U.S. will remain, in my opinion, his greatest failure.</p>",
    "q7":"Yes, I support an increase of the federal minimum wage to $15 per hour. The federal government should provide strong incentives for the private sector to provide paid sick and family leave. If these benefits are available to all federal workers, they should be available to all workers. </p><p>In my over 25 years of public service, I have supported many pro-worker measures and legislation to ensure fair and living wages, paid sick leave, pay equity, worker rights, workplace protections, and many others. I believe my advocacy and following actions have helped to improve the lives of all Maryland workers:</p><p>- Co-sponsored the Maryland Earned Sick and Safe Leave Act.</p><p>- One of only 14 delegates who voted in support of an amendment to index the MD minimum wage bill to the rate of inflation. I strongly support legislation to index as well as to increase the base wages for tipped workers.</p><p>- Support extending collective bargaining rights to companies receiving state subsidies as well as to employees and adjunct professors at all community and private colleges in Maryland.</p><p>- Support eliminating payment of \"poverty\" wages by large employers. </p><p>In Congress, I will continue to support and defend strong wage equity and protection and would stand up in opposition to any right-wing efforts that would weaken agencies such as the NLRB and OSHA, as I have done throughout my 25 years as a public official in Maryland.</p>",
    "q8":"First, it is important to understand that States, not Congress, have the broadest authority to regulate most aspects of gun ownership-- from requiring registration, licensing, training of all gun owners to regulating the sales and limiting access to guns, especially by certain individuals (minors, the mentally ill, felons, etc.) However, Congress can and must play an important role, such as we experienced with the passage of the Federal Assault Weapons Ban in 1994. Unfortunately, although bills have been introduced, Congress has not been able to re-establish the ban after it sunset in 2004. I will fight in support of such a bill. In addition, Congress can and must incentivize states to pass laws that aim to reduce gun violence, similar to those I have helped to pass in Maryland, making our state's laws some of the most comprehensive and effective gun control regulations in the nation. I am proud to have proposed and passed as part of the major 2013 Maryland Gun Control bill, two important provisions of these laws: one limiting the number of rounds permissible in a detachable magazine for a semi-automatic handgun or rifle to no more than 10 rounds; and a second, requiring lost guns to be reported by owner to police within 48 hours, in order to maintain strict control of \"stolen\" guns in the marketplace.</p>",
    "q9":"Absolutely! Maryland's redistricting process is broken and must be reformed prior to our next scheduled redistricting opportunity, after the 2020 Census. The task of redistricting is primarily a state function and not a federal responsibility. However, because our Maryland Constitution is silent and provides zero standards for Congressional districts, the current state legislature-driven process is, in fact, totally arbitrary and flawed. The primary consideration in redistricting in Maryland is, unfortunately, the protection of incumbency, regardless of demographic changes, population shifts and concentration, racial and ethnic makeup of the districts, etc. etc. I have been and will continue to be a strong advocate for greater transparency and clear, consistent standards to guide our redistricting processes. With the support of the League of Women Voters, I introduced a bill that would change the Maryland Constitution to include minimal standards for re-drawing Congressional district, the same standards as are currently established for drawing Maryland legislative districts. However, there was no support from Democratic leadership for the bill as it could \"constrain\" the ability of the legislature to draw future districts according to partisan parameters. I fully support the on-going efforts for an independent commission to review and propose alternative standards and guidelines for the next round of re-districting in the state.</p>",
    "q10":"The upcoming 2016 Presidential election offers me the unique opportunity to represent the widely diverse 8th Congressional District in Maryland. Building on my valuable past experience as a Maryland elected official, I want to fight inequities that can only be resolved at the federal level. These inequities strongly impact the lives of our hard working families, our children and our communities nationwide. I will fight for fair wages, better job and economic opportunities for all; closing education gaps and access to affordable higher education; reforming a broken immigration system and working to promote peace and security. I believe my over 30 years of public service and professional experience, my education and cultural background, and my knowledge of public policy and especially budgets, uniquely qualify me to represent the interests of Maryland residents and serve effectively in Congress at this critical time. I seek to be a strong voice for the millions of hardworking, low-income women, men, families including New Americans and immigrants, who currently are voiceless and invisible in a Republican-dominated Congress. Almost daily, I receive calls asking for help with problems that impact low-income families: a single-mother who needs paid sick leave or full-time work; a father who wants to work a better job with fair, livable wages; a child who is sick or hungry or afraid; a family whose father, mother, son or daughter has been the victim of violence or deportation. There is much that must be fixed and accomplished by Congress to improve the lives of millions of men and women working hard, every day, to achieve the American Dream for their children and families.</p>"

    "q2":"I believe we should continue working with our coalition partners to disrupt and destroy ISIS, while at the same time growing the number of international partners in the fight.

    "q7":"I do support raising the federal minimum wage, and I believe a good floor is $12.50.

Only 12% of Americans have access to paid family leave and there are too many families who are losing wages or work because they need to care for loved ones and this hurts our economy and it hurts those families.</p>",
    "q8":"I know about the toll gun violence can take having lost one of my best friends to gun violence as a child.

Reasonable steps we've taken before, like sensible background checks, cracking down on illegal gun trafficking, ending straw purchases, and closing the gun show loophole. We should also make sure that anyone deemed a terrorist can't buy a gun</p>",
    "q9":"Our current system of gerrymandering Congressional districts is unfair and undemocratic. I believe we need to introduce non-partisan redistricting reform nationwide. One of the reasons Congress is so polarized is that gerrymandered districts force our representatives to only be responsive to the most extreme members of their base. We need competitive districts where voters are picking their representatives, not the other way around.</p>",
    "q10":"I'm running for office because I believe now more than ever we need new leaders in Congress who can build diverse coalitions to deliver progressive victories. Being in Congress is more than how you vote, it's about your character and how you can make a difference. When I worked on the U.S. Senate Education committee, I was often the only person of color in the room and when I stood up to speak about the importance of Head Start, or Pell Grants and how it helps under privileged kids, people listened and it changed the conversation. Better legislation that benefited all communities was created because we had a diversity of experiences in the room. Lived experience is important, it makes decisions personal. I believe I'm the candidate in this race that is able to truly understand what working families are facing in our community and that I will be able to represent them better in the halls of Congress.</p>"

    "q8":"I don't want to take guns away from responsible citizens. It is a Constitutional right. But we need help getting to reasonable limits as to who can own guns and what type and for what reason. Background checks can protect school children from being killed in their classrooms, or our children attending a movie should not have to worry about whether they get to go home or not. Access to guns should be limited. It might also be helpful if licenses were issued with the kind of arrangements driver's licenses are controlled. It should be renewable, it should be considerate of age and ability etc. there ought to be classes required for gun safety and possession guidelines. Hundreds of children shoot or kill friends or siblings because they find a loaded gun where it shouldn't be. Maybe regulation could come in the form of ammunition control. How many bullets do you need to hunt for food? How many bullets are going to be needed if you want to protect your home and belongings from an intruder?</p>",
    "q9":"Redistricting should remain in the hands of the state rather than federal. It needs to be more bi-partisan in my opinion, the constant changing of the lines to improve a number of persons in one party or the other makes for some very awkward district lines, and it can become so jumbled that district wide initiatives don't make any sense. For instance the same street needing improvement can be in two or three districts at the same time. The same configuration will stall or make difficult finding the right solutions when it involves so many entitites.</p>",
    "q10":"We can do better, than gridlock, negativity in campaign adds, personal attacks. I want to restore a sense of representation of the people, by the people and for the people. I want to participate in using common sense for the common good. We need a positive outlook and a work together attitude that will make a difference and do better for the citizens of this great nation. We need an outsider, but also one who can be depended on to understand the people being represented. I have 40 years of service to people, community organizations, coaching, scouts, being with people in the highs and lows of life as a pastor. I know people, and I know they would really like to have decency, hope, and progress in the way we govern.</p>"

    "q1":"The proposed agreement with Iran is somewhat unsatisfactory, for a plethora of reasons. I have taken the liberty to highlight a few: There is no way we can ensure that Iran will comply with our sanctions. Not only is Iran left with significant nuclear capacity, but also the agreement additionally lifts the ban on selling advanced weapons to Iran. The deal furnishes the Iranian government with at least $50 billion in so-far frozen financing and allows Iran to buy and develop sophisticated weapons and to build a force of long-range nuclear weapons after 2025. The deal allows Iran's officials to block verification inspections and does not restrict Iran's funding of jihadist groups in Lebanon, Syria, or Yemen. For these reasons, it is difficult for me to support the agreement as it stands. I believe that diplomatic negotiations are preferable and more desired than war. There is no reason we should settle for a bad deal when we have the power to negotiate a pragmatic agreement.</p>",
    "q2":"We must do everything in our power to contain, combat, and destroy ISIL. ISIL is a direct threat to our national security, and our government has a responsibility to ensure our safety as Americans. My plan for ISIL follow four steps. The first is to work with our allies in the Middle East region to contain ISIL and stop the spread of radical Islam. We will then work with the leaders in the region to combat ISIL. We need buy-in from all stakeholders involved. America is the world's lone superpower, but that does not mean we are the world's police. Thirdly, if we come to the point when we need to declare war, we must demand that Congress votes on this most critical matter. We have a tendency to jump into conflicts and wars without a strategy, authorization, or accountability. We owe it to our service members and their families to restore the balance of power as laid out by the constitution.</P><P>Finally, we also need to monitor heavily who is coming into our country. As seen through the radicals posing as refugees from Honduras or the San Bernardino extremist on a fiancee visa. We must remain vigilant.</p>",
    "q3":"I support free trade and partnership that allow movement of American goods and services. Free trade deals can help our economy, but we must be vigilant against the currency manipulation of some of our trade partners.</p><p>Again, we must refer back to the balance of power and the central role Congress must play. It is important that we elect forward thinking leaders willing to use the \"full force and the constitutional power given to us.\" It is Congress's role to not act as spectators during these deals, but to write our legislation. Having both an MBA and a JD allows me the ability to examine and support complex matters while remaining cautious. </p><p>The TPP should combat economic crisis felt by the disappearing middle class by supporting local export industries and growing jobs that pay 18 percent more on average than non-export jobs. Moreover, expanding access to foreign markets drives investment in infrastructure that benefits everyone. Nationwide, we will experience lower tariffs that will make our American made products more competitive on the global market. The state of Maryland is in a unique position concerning its manufacturing industry. 60% of Maryland's manufacturing produces high mix, low volume high-tech products mainly in electronic and chemical manufacturing. The location of the state also provides access to major defense companies and 8 of 10 aerospace companies. Increasing exports are key to our growth, which is why it is important that we fully invest and support our industrial workforce here by re-training any displaced workers. </p>",
    "q4":"I come from a medical family. My parents spent a combined 90 years practicing obstetrics and general surgery. My late brother and sister were also pioneers in the surgical world. Our dinner conversations throughout my childhood were spent discussing the obstacles that faced the medical profession, from ensuring that people of color receive superior healthcare to the growing burden of malpractice insurance. </p><P>As an elected member of Congress, I will fight for real and true free-market principles that would ensure that the American health care system remain responsive to patients, families, and medical care givers, rather than government bureaucracy. It is important that we have access to actual quality health care and not just health insurance. </p>",
    "q5":"The financial crisis in 2008 was the result of well-intended policies without any oversight. Both the Clinton and Bush Administrations set artificially high goals to bring more people into home ownership--a very worthy cause. The problems started when Treasury started putting pressure on banks to loan money to people who sometimes could or sometimes could not afford to buy a home. This created predatory lenders and the proliferation of unqualified buyers. Financial hardships were extensive: first-time homebuyers, communities of color, folks in rural, suburban, and urban neighborhoods. </p><p>The short answer is that something needed to be done to rescue both the buyers and the banking system. The problem is that while some regulations have been successful, others have stifled private lending, which has kept people out of the housing market. Further, not one lender has gone to jail after bilking honest people out of their life savings. This is outrageous.</p><p>The bottom line is that the Dodd-Frank bill that created these regulations needs to be reformed in a more intelligently sober, less knee-jerk manner.</p>",
    "q6":"Without a doubt, the election of President Obama was one of our country's greatest accomplishments. </p><p>However, if the Affordable Care Act was his greatest accomplishment, it was also his greatest failure. He used all of his political capital on a very liberal policy that drove a wedge through Congress and ignited divisiveness of our legislature.</p><p>His presidency was a tremendous missed opportunity to work through common concerns like immigration reform or sentencing reform by poisoned the well so early in his administration.</p><p>From his presidency we have learned a valuable lesson - no one gets a 100% mandate. We must work together, break free from our hyper-partisan views and focus on the American people and our constituents. </p><p>That is what I want to provide for Maryland's 8th Congressional - a return pragmatic, future-focused leadership. We have done so in the past, and this is our opportunity now. </p>",
    "q7":"The critical issue facing our nation is economic sustainability. A lot of attention is placed on minimum wage, but the main problem that there are way too many people working for it. We must bring back the American Wage (family and life sustaining). We are Wal-Marting our society, and this is unacceptable. We need to invest in everyone. College does not ensure success these days. Our education system should serve everyone, not just college bound. I will ensure that blue collar/skilled labor is moved out of the endnotes and back into the main agenda. Some think we are an my \"affluent\" district, but the latest economic downturn proves, no one is immune. </p><P>We should consider the possibility of the federal government sick time and family leave, but I am concern that another requirement would mean more burden on businesses. Our families are sandwiched between caring for their children and their parents while maintaining their jobs. Though I have not had the opportunity to act as a public official, as a young professional, I have discussed the life balance dynamic with my peers. Work-life balance is a critical issue, particularly for us working women. We want to pursue our careers, but we want to be free to build and care for our families. I am encouraged to see many in the private sector have created solutions to support families. Through incentives, we can encourage the sort of conscious capitalism that we desperately need in our modern society.</p>",
    "q8":"I support the strong majority of Americans — including 87% of Republicans and 84% of gun owners — that believe background checks should be required for gun purchases made at gun shows and especially online. We must hold these vendors accountable. This is a simple, broadly supported, common-sense policy. There are many laws on the books already that if enforced would begin to address gun violence.</p><p>But, outlawing particular gun manufacturers, make and model is NOT the solution. In fact it hurts the industrial and manufacturing economy of Maryland. If elected to represent Maryland's 8th Congressional District, I will fight to fix the background loopholes while supporting the principles of the Second Amendment as a fundamental right. Here in Maryland our citizens demand the practical benefits of gun rights, such as self-protection and hunting, especially in places in more rural areas like Northern Montgomery, Carroll and Frederick counties.</p>",
    "q9":"Redistricting reform is a democratic imperative. Maryland gerrymandering is one of the main reasons I left the Democratic Party. Democrats purposefully dissected our state in the hopes of creating an all-Democratic congressional delegation and to protect Democratic incumbents. Maryland is too diverse of a state to stifle. Our heritage stems from both the Union and the Confederacy. We must respect such differences, learn from them, and grow together. The Democratic Party purposefully brought CD8 up through Frederick and Carroll to suppress conservative voices. This is unjust.</p><p>I am the only candidate of the 17 who took an active step to try to represent our gerrymandered district when I stepped out of the system and tried to run as an independent. Now, I believe that a proactive moderate conservative would most benefit our new district as it is; moreover, the rest of the partisan candidates disregard the effect of our hardship. This congressional district may the one of the few regions that can elect an inclusive candidate such as myself. We do not have to wait for reform. We can remedy the problem now through my candidacy.</p><p>We must launch an immediate federal effort to create fair and independent redistricting reform to alleviate such damage nationwide. Because it occurs nationwide and it has such a national effect, reform must be generated from the federal level. I believe that gerrymandering is one of the main culprits that has degraded our politics into the divisively polarizing and highly contentious unproductiveness that we suffer.</p>",
    "q10":"I believe this is our one chance to get things right.</p><p>I am running for Congress because I do not want to give up on our country. Seven years ago we had a tremendous opportunity to bring our country together and lead, but hyper-partisan tactics have destroyed our government. And we the people have lost our faith. The immense power of lobbyists, millionaires and billionaires, and career politicians ends now. If we want to preserve our republic, we must address our democratic and economic system head on, with term limits, independent redistricting nationwide, and investing economic security.</p><p>Over the last 6 months, I have witnessed the destructive force of partisan politics. I am the only candidate from the 17 people running for this seat who took active and deliberate measures to represent the entire district, not just one region or one extreme wing.</p><p>This is a huge opportunity for citizens to take power back. We cannot wait for reform, we need to take action now. We need candidates who are willing to step outside their comfort zone. Congresswomen who are sensitive to the needs of her entire district, not just the ones who have the most money and power. That antiquated way of governing is what got us into the mess we are in in the first place. We need a new approach and we need it now.</p>"

    "q1":"Given Iran's revolutionary history since 1979 and support for terrorist organizations, we should never allow them to obtain a nuclear weapon. After reviewing the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action or \"Iran Agreement,\" and talking with leaders in national security, and the Jewish and Muslim communities, I believe this is not a perfect deal, but the best opportunity to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon, and I believe that Congress acted wisely in approving the agreement and giving diplomacy a chance to work.</p><p>That said, I remain deeply suspicious of the Iranian regime. As a news reporter, I covered the Iranian hostage crisis and interviewed hostages upon their return to the U.S. in 1980. This is a government that has proven time and again to be untrustworthy.</p><p>That's why in Congress I will be a vigilant champion for America's interests to make sure the agreement is based on diligent enforcement and not simply trust or hope. If any significant piece of this agreement is breached by the Iranians, we must, with the help of the global community, re-impose the harsh sanctions regime that brought the Iranians to the negotiating table in the first place, and all options should be on the table.</p><p>In spite of all the unresolved issues between the United States and Iran, the Iran Agreement is also an opportunity. After four decades of distrust between our two nations, the success of the Agreement could help empower moderate leadership in Iran. </p>",
    "q2":"The metastasizing growth of the Islamic State (ISIS) that has expanded its reach from Iraq and Syria to nearly 50 affiliates in 21 countries must be destroyed. As ISIS attempts to create a caliphate globally and through cyberspace, it is the newest threat to global security and must be defeated by the US and our allies in the European Union, Turkey, and Sunni Arab states, without getting bogged down in endless military ground commitments.</p><p>At the same time, we must facilitate a transition to moderate Syrian leadership and re-direct Russia and Iran from their strategy of propping up Bashar al-Assad's brutal regime. This must be accomplished without letting state structures collapse and creating a vacuum as happened in Iraq after the US invasion and war. In the meantime, the US must take the lead in Syria to address the humanitarian crisis that has resulted in 250,000 dead and 12 million Syrian refugees. This should include humanitarian corridors and a safe zone for civilians in northern Syria and may require a no-fly zone to enforce it, ideally in coordination with Russia.</p>",
    "q3":"The US has trade agreements with 20 countries that represent 6 percent of the world's consumers and 9 percent of the global GDP. As a result of those pacts and globalization, more than 30 percent of US GDP is tied to international trade and investment, and more than one in five US jobs is supported by trade. However, we have seen trade agreements, such as NAFTA, that resulted in job losses and have not significantly increased exports.</p><p>A trade partnership with the 12 Trans-Pacific nations would open access to 40 percent of global trade. It would reduce 18,000 tariffs on goods, services and facilitate investment flowing between the US to Japan, Vietnam and 9 other countries. This will potentially benefit hundreds of millions of people. Perhaps as important, the TPP will bind these countries together diplomatically against China. Having a counterweight against China, given her flexing in the region, is an important strategic goal.</p><p>That said, we must ensure that the agreement is a net plus and creates more exports, adds US jobs, promotes fair labor practices, human rights, and protects the environment in other countries. The International Trade Commission conducted hearings and analysis of the TPP and will present its report to Congress in May 2016. While I have concerns about the issues raised by environmental groups and opposition by labor unions who fear that currency manipulation will result in job losses, I am eager to see the ITC's final report before committing to support or reject the TPP.</p>",
    "q4":"I am a strong believer that having access to affordable health care is a basic human right. The Affordable Care Act has significantly expanded access to healthcare, especially for people with pre-existing conditions, youth under the age of 26, and women who now have greater preventative care and can no longer be charged more than a man for basic health services. New figures released in 2015 by the annual Census Bureau Survey show that nearly 9 million more people had coverage in 2014, and the share of the people uninsured fell to 10.4 percent from 13.3 percent in 2013. But there are still people who fall through the cracks.</p><P>I believe that we can make the Affordable Care Act even better by expanding access to more people and ensuring that women have coverage for preventive care and family planning. While contraception coverage was initially required by health insurance plans provided by employers, this mandate was reversed by the Supreme Court through the 2014 decision in Burwell v. Hobby Lobby. The Supreme Court determined that for-profit corporations could deny health insurance coverage to employees for religious reasons. This was a poor decision. An employer should not be able to dictate the type of healthcare decisions made by an employee. In Congress, I would support legislation that restores employers' compliance to provide contraception coverage.</p>",
    "q5":"Yes, I believe that the Dodd-Frank Law has been vital in bringing accountability to Wall Street, and I will continue to support efforts to prevent the dangerous financial environment that led to the Great Recession, including increased funding to the SEC to provide better oversight of Wall Street.</p><p>Additionally, given the historic level of income inequality, it is clear that we need progressive tax reform. It is unacceptable that hedge fund managers pay a lower tax rate than teachers and firefighters. I support raising the tax on capital gains, closing the carried interest loophole, making corporations pay their fair share of taxes, and other progressive measures so that we can begin to reduce income inequality in this country.</p>",
    "q6":"I believe President Barack Obama will be remembered in history as one of our great Presidents in the tradition of Franklin Roosevelt and Abraham Lincoln. Coming into office in 2009 during the Great Recession, he enacted policies that halved unemployment from 10% to under 5%, put millions of Americans back to work, and created greater regulation of the institutions that caused the financial crisis. Also like Franklin Roosevelt, who created retirement security for older Americans, President Obama has created health security for millions more Americans with the passage of the Affordable Care Act.</p><P>At the same time, he has confronted terrorism by capturing Osama Bin Laden, going after Al Queda and ISIS, and securing a nuclear agreement with Iran. Like Teddy Roosevelt, he's been a great environmental leader who has confronted the crisis of climate change with a green power plan. And as the country's first African American President, he has addressed issues of racial and religious discrimination with moral courage similar to President Lincoln. Similar to Lincoln, who confronted a divided country, President Obama has faced an intensely partisan political environment. Perhaps President Obama could have leveraged his significant interpersonal skills and power of persuasion to get more buy-in for his progressive agenda, but that's been challenging with a Republican Congress that seems more intent on preventing his success than getting things done to help the American people.</p>",
    "q7":"As a member of a union during my journalism career and working in business for 9 years, I know the value of a fair wage. The current minimum wage is no longer a living wage. As a member of Congress, I will support legislation to raise the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour, but I also believe that state and local efforts to boost the minimum wage are crucial in the interim. Montgomery County is raising the minimum wage to $11.50 an hour and across Maryland we're increasing the minimum wage to $10.10 an hour. All working families deserve to have the financial security that comes from a living wage.</p><p>Additionally, I believe that workers should never have to choose between losing a job and taking care of a sick family member. That's why in Congress I plan to be a co-sponsor of the Family and Medical Insurance Leave Act, which will provide up to 12 weeks of paid leave for new mothers and 12 weeks of partial compensation for workers to take care of sick children or family members. Montgomery County has led the way on this issue, passing legislation to require county employers to provide earned sick leave to an estimated 90,000 workers who don't currently have it. We need to do the same for workers all across America. Providing paid leave is simply good for families and good for our economy because it keeps people in the workforce.</p>",
    "q8":"While I covered many issues important to this region as a TV reporter, too often our stories focused on crime, gun violence and terrorism, like the 2002 \"Beltway Sniper\" killing spree in which 13 people were killed over a three week period. Too often the discussion about gun control comes up during these tragic events and then fades away with time and pressure from the gun lobby. While Maryland has successfully passed strong gun control measures, we can and must do more on a national level. </p><p>In Congress, I will support expansive gun safety policies including universal background checks for all gun sales to prevent dangerous people from having easy access to deadly weapons. I believe that we should also require background checks for the purchase of ammunition because crimes are frequently committed with stolen guns. Trigger locks and other gun safety mechanisms can prevent accidental shootings that too often claim children's lives. We must also invest in our mental health services and have an open dialogue about mental health issues to make sure that people who might use guns to harm themselves or others are getting the treatment they need. Additionally, I will be a strong supporter of public service campaigns to instill responsible gun safety practices, boost child safety and education, and remove the stigma from getting mental health diagnoses and quality care.</p>",
    "q9":"Reforming the way we draw Congressional district lines is a critical step to improving the way Washington works. In Maryland we have some of the most gerrymandered districts in the nation, and we have districts that join parts of the state that are hundreds of miles away from each other. The 8th District, in which I am running, resembles a mushroom and stretches from the DC to Pennsylvania border with some communities divided among three different congressional districts.</p><p>Unfortunately both political parties are responsible for creating Congressional districts that result in safe seats and uncompetitive general election campaigns. Many in our state are left without a voice because too often the election is decided during the primary. And many states have Congressional delegations that are not reflective of the voters simply because of the way districts are drawn.</p><p>I believe that we need real reform and will support legislation at either federal or state level. I think we will have more success addressing this issue at the federal level instead of a patchwork of laws across the country. Ultimately we need to get both parties on board to support changes to the system, and I will work to build a bi-partisan coalition in Congress to get this done.</p>",
    "q10":"Like many Americans, I am frustrated by the partisan battles that have created political gridlock in Washington, and I believe my broad experience as a journalist and in business has given me the skills to be effective in building bridges to get things done to address income inequality and grow our economy. As a working mom, I am passionate about the need to create an opportunity agenda to help all working families succeed. I also believe we need to stand up to the gun lobby and pass strong gun safety legislation to make our communities safer.</p><p>I came to Washington after college because I wanted to serve my country and be deeply involved in my community. In journalism, I found a way to serve the public by reporting on the needs and challenges of the people who live here and keeping politicians honest. During my career, I reported on issues that were important to the region like education, crime, and politics. </p><p>Later, joining a business that has created hundreds of thousands of jobs in Maryland and across the world, I was able to advance an equality agenda for women and families, lead initiatives to create new jobs, and protect the planet through sustainable practices. I'm now running for Congress because I believe that I can further serve this area by fighting for progressive causes in Washington like raising the minimum wage, enacting immigration reform, and fighting to protect Social Security and Medicare.</p>"

    "q1":"To keep the peace and to nourish hope for stability and social progress in the Mideast, we must prevent the Iranian regime from becoming a nuclear power. I endorsed the Iran nuclear deal in the summer after several weeks of close study of the proposal. I became convinced that the Agreement successfully cut off a plutonium pathway to a nuclear weapon and a uranium pathway while also imposing a muscular \"snapback\" sanctions provision. We need to vigorously enforce the terms of the agreement, including the comprehensive inspection regime, to ensure there is no cheating and that the \"snap-back\" sanctions remain a swift and effective deterrent to subterfuge and circumvention. Congress can also act to strengthen the deal in numerous ways, and it has every reason to do so.</p>",
    "q2":"ISIS is a terrorist death cult committed to savage attacks on civilians all over the world. Although the bitter folly of the Iraq War created the chaos and vacuum of power in which ISIS was born, we have no alternative right now to a policy of crushing and destroying ISIS. We must move aggressively to shrink the territory ISIS holds, strip it of control of the oilfields and disable the oil infrastructure, bomb the transportation modules, and above all use every domestic and international banking institutional resource we have to cut off the regional and global flow of money to ISIS. If we mobilize the military and financial resources of the U.S. and our allies, we should be able quickly to degrade the terror infrastructure that this group thrives on. However, in order to forestall the rise of the next terrorist theocratic movement with imperial and irredentist designs on a modern-day caliphate (remember how ISIS replaced Al Qaeda), we need to promote human rights, democracy and the rule of law throughout the Arab world to counter Islamist propaganda. We also need to help unify this torn and ailing region with diplomacy and new patterns of social, political, cultural and economic development. Critical to the economic and political success of nations in the region is the protection of the equal rights of women and the promotion of educational and career opportunities for women.</p>",
    "q3":"Free trade is generally good for all the reasons that Adam Smith, David Ricardo and the 18th-century liberals posited: it reduces military and ideological conflict among nations, brings the people of the world into peaceful and constructive contact, and permits each nation to develop a \"comparative advantage\" or two while stimulating global commerce. However, in the current period, many of our free trade deals, beginning with NAFTA, have not been about simply removing tariffs and trade barriers—if they were, the agreements, would be 3 pages long—but rather facilitating access and advantage for large multinational corporations by dismantling domestic environmental, safety, health, labor, constitutional, and workplace regulations and even replacing domestic tribunals with corporate-dominated investor dispute arbitration mechanisms. These dynamics have not served the public interest in our country. Our trade deficit in 2015 was more than $500 billion and more than $365 billion alone with China, which means our trade imbalance with China grows $1 billion every single day. We have already outsourced more than three million service sector jobs and the TPP will undoubtedly further accelerate job flight. In the manufacturing sector, the U.S. lost nearly 700,000 jobs due to NAFTA, 2.7 million jobs as a result of the Permanent Normal Trade Relations with China, and 70,000 jobs in the wake of the Korea agreement. I strongly favor free and fair trade but am deeply skeptical of deals like TPP which become captive to special-interest demands and lose sight of the overall common good.</p>",
    "q4":"While expansion of coverage to more than 18 million Americans has been an essential success with the ACA, health care costs remain way too high. Part of the problem is the cost of insurance bureaucracy and paperwork, but we have little room to maneuver around that until we get to a single-payer plan and that will take some years to get there. More immediately, we need to press forward with Medicare's payment reform experiments, such as the Accountable Care Organization, which is paid more when patients are actually healed and cured rather than simply seen and processed. The shift to outcome-based payment is historic but requires systematic research and analysis. I am advocating increased funding of biomedical sciences, including key units at the National Institutes of Health and the Agency for Health Research and Quality at HHS, in order to better study, understand and then improve the quality and effectiveness of health care actually being delivered under the ACA.</p>",
    "q5":"The mortgage meltdown crisis of 2008 cost Americans millions of jobs and homes and trillions of dollars in home equity, retirement and pension fund savings. The recklessness and misconduct on Wall Street inflicted terrible burdens on the American people, and were especially punishing to poor communities. This crisis hit Maryland hard. President Obama initiated a series of strong and overdue reforms of the financial sector, and the Dodd-Frank legislation was essential. But the reforms remain incomplete and we need to continue aggressive action to regulate reckless risk-taking and structural conflicts of interest in the financial sector. Specifically, financial regulators have not yet completed essential rulemaking processes to impose limits on incentive compensation for financial services executives. These reforms are necessary to limit excessively predatory risk-taking behavior and rein in some of the most destabilizing tendencies on Wall Street. They are also necessary to dampen some of the outrageous economic and political inequalities that now define the Citizens United age. Similarly, reforms regarding derivatives have stalled and compel our serious attention. We should also strengthen whistleblower statutes so that individuals can report cases of misconduct before they become a full-blown crisis. Fundamentally, we need regulators who will work for the American people, not for private interests.</p>",
    "q6":"I have always strongly supported President Obama and was proud to have chaired his 2008 presidential campaign in Montgomery County. We graduated from high school and college the same year, and I preceded him by three years as an Editor of the Harvard Law Review. I think he will be seen as a president who began to rescue us from the economic and foreign policy calamities of the George W. Bush administration and restored momentum to the progress of popular political and economic democracy. His administration (which my wife Sarah serves in, as Deputy Secretary of the Treasury Department) brought us out of recession; presided over major jobs growth; passed the Affordable Care Act, which not only brought 18 million new Americans under health insurance coverage but guaranteed coverage to people with preexisting conditions and to young people up to 25 years old who could stay on their family plans; named (at least) two great Supreme Court Justices in Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan; reestablished ties with Cuba; and revived American diplomacy and international leadership while disengaging from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Major failures, mostly due to partisan obstructionism, include the lack of progress on immigration reform and the failure to enact small-donor public financing and reverse Citizens United. History will record that the opposition set out to blockade President Obama at every turn but he was resilient and kept his vision trained on some big and crucial breakthroughs.</p>",
    "q7":"Yes, I'm an ardent advocate of increasing the minimum wage so working-class people can actually support their families. I support the Raise the Wage Act of 2015 that would raise the wage to $12 an hour. In the Maryland Senate, I built unanimous support for a progressive increase in Maryland's minimum wage over several years. Raising the minimum wage nationally would directly or indirectly raise wages for 35.1 million workers. Raising the minimum wage for tipped workers in Maryland is an imperative this year. This is critical for waitresses and waiters—what other group has to appeal to consumers in order to win a full minimum wage? The federal government should certainly move to require paid sick time and family leave. The lack of a paid sick days policy is bad employment policy and bad public health policy. I support the Healthy Families Act of 2015, which would require all businesses with more than 15 employees to offer up to seven paid sick days a year. We are doing this in Maryland this year! Similarly, no worker should lose his or her job because of the need to care for a family member. The Center for Economic and Policy Research analyzed firms with fewer than fifty employees that voluntarily complied with the Family Medical Leave Act and reported easy implementation and few negative effects, including no evidence that it poses a financial hardship on these firms. These laws are the mark of a civilized society.</p>",
    "q8":"I am a passionate critic of our uncivilized gun laws and the obscene gun violence engulfing America. We need to bring the essential features of the common-sense law we passed in Maryland into being at the federal level. Then–Senator and now Attorney General Brian Frosh and I wrote and steered to passage in 2013 one of the toughest comprehensive gun safety laws in the nation. This session, I'm fighting to compel convicted domestic abusers to surrender all firearms and to pass universal background checks for all types of firearms. In Congress, I will be a relentless advocate for universal background checks, which are a necessity to prevent gun-runners, murderers, and other criminals from obtaining firearms. We also need a Maryland-style fingerprinting system to eliminate the possibility of straw purchasers acquiring firearms for criminals. We should also close the so-called \"Charleston loophole,\" which allows a gun sale to proceed without a completed background check if the check has not been finished within three days. This loophole permitted racist Dylann Roof to purchase a gun before he executed nine people point-blank in a Charleston church even though he had a disqualifying criminal record. I would also work to expand the categories of people barred from purchasing and possessing firearms. Federal law should also prohibit people convicted of domestic abuse from possessing guns. I also would propose that Congress extend federal gun prohibitions to cover partners who have violated permanent or temporary court-ordered domestic violence restraining orders.</p>",
    "q9":"Our redistricting process needs sweeping reform. Elected officials are choosing voters before choose elected officials. This session in Annapolis, I introduced legislation for an interstate compact to establish a single independent redistricting commission— the Potomac Compact for Fair Representation—composed of citizens and experts (no politicians) to design fair districts and proportional voting plans in Maryland and Virginia. Our states make great partners in this effort because we are political opposites—Maryland has a Republican governor and Democratic legislature and Virginia has the reverse. Maryland and Virginia should jump together towards a fairer process and result. We need to explore moving away from single-member districting, which is intertwined inevitably with partisan gerrymandering, towards multi-member districts along with proportional representation voting practices that will empower political minorities and promote broader representation. The aesthetics of district lines are a clue something is profoundly wrong but they are not the constitutional sin itself. Maryland is an oddly-shaped state because of the Chesapeake Bay and we will not be able to draw rectangular districts. The real problem is a 7-1 Democratic-Republican split in the Congressional delegation which does not mirror political preferences in the state; similarly, in Virginia, a state with two Democratic Senators, a Democratic Governor and solid majorities for President Obama in 2008 and 2012, Republicans in the legislature have drawn an indefensible 7-3 Republican-Democratic split. If both parties put skin in the game, we can make progress on a fairer allocation of Congressional seats to reflect the popular will.</p>",
    "q10":"When I first ran for the State Senate, I was repeatedly told that I could not win, and I could never accomplish the bold progressive agenda I was running on: passing marriage equality, abolishing the death penalty, banning military-style assault weapons, restoring voting rights to ex-felons, passing the National Popular Vote plan, enacting a medical marijuana program, and adopting a strong renewable energy plan to dramatically lower greenhouse gas emissions. Yet, not only did I win but, over the last decade, we have passed all of these bills--and I sponsored and also was the floor leader for most of them. So I have seen legislative democracy work and been part of some thrilling breakthrough victories in perhaps the most legislatively productive decade in the history of our state. When Congressman Van Hollen called to tell me he was running for Senate, I knew immediately I wanted to run for his seat because so many of the problems we face today are national and international in scope. We might have one of the best gun safety laws in America but we will continue to have bloody summers like the one we had in Baltimore if the guns just keep flowing in from New Jersey, Virginia, and Pennsylvania. Similarly, we might have among the best environmental laws in America but more than 50 waterways flow into the Bay from out-of-state, and climate change is a civilizational emergency requiring swift and sweeping national and global response. I want to put my demonstrably effective parliamentary skills, political leadership and coalition-building experience and constitutional knowledge to work for a revival of progressive Democratic ideas and organizing in Congress. I have been endorsed by Congressman John Sarbanes, the Congressional Progressive Caucus, the Sierra Club and the NEA, among dozens of others.</p>"

    "q1":"The Iran nuclear agreement is an historic victory for peace and diplomacy. It prevents a nuclear armed Iran. It's strong, verifiable, and backed by our major allies. It terminates an existential threat to Israel and turns the page on the idea that the U.S. should use the military first to resolve our international challenges. Diplomacy – when backed by the smart leveraging of sanctions and in concert with the international community – is the best path to achieving our security goals.</p><p>I'm proud to have played a key role in building the political space for diplomacy with Iran over the last decade. As the founding Political and Government Affairs Director of J Street and later the Policy Director at Ploughshares Fund, I sought to change the political debate around American foreign policy in the Middle East. </p><p>For too long, there was no debate about our foreign policy in the Middle East. And the result was the disastrous war in Iraq. I vowed to not let that happen again and am proud to have helped support the creation of a debate about how best to stop an Iranian bomb.</p><p>And when the Obama Administration appointed me to serve as the Deputy Assistant Secretary of State to the House of Representatives, one of my top responsibilities was to lay the groundwork for the agreement to get through Congress. We did this successfully, including with the support of Rep. Van Hollen, and now Iran's pathways towards getting the bomb have been verifiably blocked.</p>",
    "q2":"My experience as a senior national security official, as well as a Political-Military Affairs officer at the State Department, have provided me with the training to ask the hard questions that must be asked by Congress to ensure that we conclusively win this fight. I am the only candidate in this race with national security experience.</p><p>The fight against ISIS however is not ours alone, and we need a strategy that comprehensively integrates our civilian, diplomatic, intelligence, law enforcement, and military efforts, as well as enlists a diverse coalition of allies in the fight. </p><p>We also need Congress to pass an Authorization for the Use of Military Force. President Obama has requested one but the Republicans have failed to deliver. Without the clear backing of Congress, our allies doubt our resolve and the American people are not fully on board. This situation reduces our effectiveness, undermines our own fighters, and weakens our democracy. </p><p>Lastly, we must provide the necessary resources to wage an aggressive campaign to win this fight. Yet resources are scarce because we are wasting billions of dollars on the wrong weapons systems. We invest too much in Cold War nuclear weapons to the tune of $60 to $70 billion per year and too little in the hardware and software that will defeat today's terrorist enemy, both on the battlefield and online. Our defense spending priorities are backwards, and if elected to Congress, I will work daily to change that dynamic so that we decisively defeat ISIS.</p>",
    "q3":"I do not support the Trans-Pacific Partnership because it fails to protect American workers from competition with workers in low-wage countries. It also fails to hold our trade partners to the strict environmental standards necessary to seriously combat climate change, as well as weakens human rights in these countries. And it will likely fail to either create jobs in the U.S. or reduce our trade deficit. </p><p>However, I do support trade agreements that promote fair trade policies. As a former Peace Corps Volunteer, I deeply believe in American engagement with the rest of the world – including through trade – and want to ensure that we have trade deals that help both Americans and people around the world.</p><p>Historically, when forced to compete with workers in low-wage companies in an unregulated free market trade agreement, American workers are laid off by the tens of thousands and those who are lucky enough to keep their jobs see their wages stagnate or decline. Under NAFTA, our trade deficit with Mexico flipped from a $1.7 billion surplus to a $61.4 billion deficit, and we lost hundreds of thousands of American jobs. We need fair trade, not free trade. </p><p>This is why, in an era where a handful of corporations and wealthy individuals have more resources than billions of workers across the globe combined, it's more critical than ever that we fight for policies that promote a sustainable future for all of us, not just for wealthy CEOs and the likes of Donald Trump.</p>",
    "q4":"The Affordable Care Act was a critical first step towards getting us to a healthcare system that provides quality, affordable care for all Americans. 2014 saw the largest drop in the uninsured rate we've ever seen. Adults and children with pre-existing conditions no longer have to fear losing their coverage. Price discrimination against women is illegal. These are substantial improvements and our healthcare system is moving in the right direction.</p><p>I had major surgery two years ago, and I remember very well how fortunate I was to have coverage. It was terrifying to imagine that if I had lost my job, I could lose my coverage, or that my coverage perhaps wouldn't be good enough and I would have to pay medical bills that I could not afford. This didn't happen, and now, because of the Affordable Care Act, fears like this have disappeared for tens of millions of Americans. Access to healthcare is now a right for all, not an item only for those who can afford it. </p><p>Yet the ACA is not perfect. And neither is our current insurance system. We need to strive for more and to pressure the insurance companies to do better. We should consider implementing a public option to both improve service and increase that pressure. And we must resist obsessive Republican attempts to take healthcare away from millions of Americans while at the same time fight to expand Medicaid to all states, so that every American has access to quality, affordable healthcare.</p>",
    "q5":"I applaud Congress and the Obama Administration's intentions in passing the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. It created mechanisms for transparency in the financial markets and established the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau – a government watchdog designed to make more effective rules for financial markets and enforce those rules to empower and protect consumers. </p><p>But Dodd-Frank does not do nearly enough to restore American confidence in our economy or our government's ability to mitigate future risk. We can and should do better, as too many families across the country and in the 8th District live on the edge of economic insecurity. </p><p>So at a time when our largest banking institutions have received $16 trillion or more in nearly zero interest loans from the Federal Reserve, we need to level the playing field for ordinary Americans who have seen their wealth and wages stagnate for too long while hedge fund managers make billions in profit. And we need to fight back against Republican attempts to undermine reform, by appropriately funding the agencies we need to protect us from the next financial crisis.</p><p>Ultimately, a more holistic approach to Wall Street reform that focuses not only on irresponsible and risky speculation in our markets, but also ends the \"too big to fail\" era of banking, ends the cronyism and revolving door that still exists between Wall Street and the U.S. Government, and protects American consumers from exorbitant interest rates will help us achieve the ultimate goals that Dodd-Frank sought.</p>",
    "q6":"I had the privilege of serving in a senior position in President Obama's Administration and believe that he brought a levelheaded, rational, and uniquely thoughtful approach to the White House that our country desperately needed after George W. Bush. The nation will sorely miss him once he leaves office. Republican journalist David Brooks said it best in his recent New York Times article: \"Many of the traits of character and leadership that Obama possesses, and that maybe we have taken too much for granted, have suddenly gone missing or are in short supply.\"</p><p>Of President Obama's many great accomplishments, I would point to the sixty straight months of consistent job growth; healthcare reform, where now millions of Americans have quality coverage; social progress for women and LGBTQ Americans; a focus on criminal justice reform, gun violence prevention measures, and restoring voting rights; achievement of a global accord to combat climate change; and preventing Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon without firing a single shot while restoring America's diplomatic standing around the world. </p><p>These accomplishments form the foundation of his legacy. Yet considering the relentless opposition President Obama confronted from the GOP throughout his tenure, these accomplishments are even more remarkable, and are a testament to his incredible vision and leadership. While I wish the President could have passed more meaningful Wall Street reforms and done more to prevent destabilization in Syria, his presidency represents a stark turnaround from the miserable previous eight years. We cannot return to those dark days.</p>",
    "q7":"We must have an economy that works for everyone, not just for CEOs and the wealthy. So, I stand with millions of workers and the labor community in support of raising the federal minimum wage to $15 over the next several years. </p><p>If elected, I will fight every day to raise the minimum wage and to ensure that women earn equal pay for equal work. We can get this done, but it will require a Representative who understands how Congress works and who has the experience, as I do, in building a broad coalition of support to pressure Republicans to do the right thing. </p><p>Ensuring a living wage is as much a human rights issue as it is an economic issue for millions of American workers, especially for women who make up two-thirds of our minimum wage workforce. </p><p>And as a former federal civil servant, I understand how valuable it is to have paid sick leave and family leave. All Americans should have these benefits, which strengthen our families, keep us healthy, and ensure that our workers have peace of mind so that they can be effective in the workplace and not live in fear of getting sick.</p><p>Finally, we should think more broadly about our workforce and do more to help families struggling to make ends meet. We can do this by providing universal Pre-K and affordable childcare, by strengthening and expanding Social Security and Medicare, and by making sure that every American has access to quality affordable healthcare.</p>",
    "q8":"We cannot allow our schools, universities, movie theaters, and neighborhoods to be shooting galleries for acts of gun violence. Every day more than thirty Americans are killed on average from gun violence, and firearms homicide is the second leading cause of death for young people under twenty years old.</p><p>I therefore support common sense measures, which we know with certainty will have an immediate impact on gun violence and that an overwhelming majority of Americans, as well as responsible gun owners, support.</p><p>In Congress, I will continue Congressman Van Hollen's leadership on this issue and join with the millions of Americans who demand action now. We need a comprehensive federal background check system, one already supported by nine out of ten Americans. We need to close the gun show loophole that allows people to buy firearms without a background check. We need to reinstate the ban on military-style assault weapons that have no place on our streets, and to ban large capacity ammunition clips. We need to crack down on straw purchasers who buy guns for people who would not pass a background check, by making it a felony offense. And we need to strengthen federal law to prohibit anyone convicted of domestic abuse from ever buying a gun. </p><p>For years I have successfully battled the extreme right in Congress that has wanted to entangle our country in never-ending wars. I will stand up just the same to the NRA's lobbyists who likewise want to put our safety at risk.</p>",
    "q9":"We must change the way our states apportion state and federal legislative districts, and we need to act aggressively to get this done before 2020, the next time districts will be redrawn. Real leadership requires that this be done for the good of the public and the integrity of our political process.</p><p>This should be a bipartisan issue, as both Democrats and Republicans have recently been responsible for the worst cases of gerrymandering we have ever seen - the case in Maryland - as technology has made it increasingly easier to group voters in ways that benefit the party making the decisions. Gerrymandering not only impacts the competitiveness of each district, giving one party a clear advantage, but also minority communities are consistently disenfranchised by this process by diluting their impact in state and congressional elections. </p><p>The good news is people across the country are voicing their concerns and making progress towards a more independent redistricting process. Since 2010, courts have played a major role in judging the fairness of how districts are redrawn, reviewing congressional districts in 22 states and actually redrawing district lines in nine states. </p><p>While I'm open to a federal process for redrawing congressional districts, particularly as reapportionment is based on the federal census, I believe we should be proactive and give states the space to work towards an equitable solution. Should federal intervention become necessary, allowing states to work these issues out first will provide us with the alternatives and justification to do so fairly.</p>",
    "q10":"I'm running for Congress because I'm a champion for progressive values who gets results at the federal level. Our Congress is broken and we need leaders there who are willing to roll up their sleeves and, on day one, make an impact. I'm job-ready, and am a unique candidate in this race because I have a track of record of success in working directly with the U.S. House of Representatives in a leading role on some of the most complex issues of the day. </p><p>I have lived in the district for the last decade with my wife, our three daughters, and my mother-in-law, who immigrated to the United States from Sri Lanka in the 1970s. We care deeply about our community and are active in it; my two oldest daughters go to public school and the third is on her way. Yet I have witnessed first hand the erosion of women's rights, economic and retirement security, environmental protections, campaign finance laws, public education, and protections for immigrants and our LGBT brothers and sisters, all at the hands of an extreme right-wing ideology that prefers to have a broken Congress that doesn't get things done. That's not the way it always was. And for the sake of all our children, we cannot let this continue.</p><p>Our district desperately needs a Congress that works, and I'm running to both change our politics and to get things done, because I already have. I know how to build advocacy coalitions to move policy, as I did in promoting diplomacy with Iran as an activist for six years, working actively with leaders on both sides of the aisle to ensure that Iran would not possess a nuclear weapon. And I know how to work intimately with federal agencies on behalf of our district, as I was a civil servant for seven years and understand how federal agencies work – a key skill that will directly benefit our district and both the agencies and employees in it. </p><p>We should expect more from our Congress, and I hope to build upon the strong work of our current Congressman Chris Van Hollen.</p>"

    "q1":"I am opposed to the Iran nuclear deal, because I do not believe Iran is interested in abandoning its goal of attaining nuclear weapons. Iran has a long history of violating U.N. Security resolutions and giving weapons inspectors the runaround. As recently as December 2015, the International Atomic Energy Agency confirmed that Iran has been lying about the country's nuclear objectives all along.</p><p>Furthermore, Iran has a long record of sponsoring terror, murdering innocent civilians, and inflicting human rights abuses on its own citizens. It is clear that if and when it becomes a nuclear state, Iran will use its new power to target its enemies – especially Israel and the United States. </p><p>President Obama's Iran deal gives Iran the economic relief and time it needs to achieve its dangerous goal. Re-imposing sanctions is our best hope of choking off Iran before it's too late.</p>",
    "q2":"The Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) is a growing threat, and its efforts to spread radical Islam through brutality must be stopped with force, not with words. America needs to work with its allies to enact a comprehensive plan to combat ISIS – not an ad-hoc, piecemeal effort that wastes American resources and puts American soldiers in harm's way. </p><p>This plan should include American and allied troops on the ground, working in conjunction with Kurds and Sunni tribes to provide logistical and intelligence support. The international coalition should also expand airstrikes; expand intelligence partnerships to hinder jihadist travel from training grounds back to their home countries; and expand efforts to counteract ISIS propaganda and recruitment online. Domestically, it is imperative that we enhance U.S. intelligence capabilities to track domestic terrorist plots.</p>",
    "q3":"Trade agreements need to carefully balance the needs of American workers with the needs of business and our economic future. I support free trade that benefits all countries and protects American interests. Unfortunately, the Trans-Pacific Partnership does not achieve those goals. I have concerns about how the trade deal treats U.S. intellectual property rights and exempts state-owned enterprises in countries like China. There are also signs that the trade deal will create more new regulatory barriers than it knocks down existing ones.</p>",
    "q4":"This is another example of how Washington is broken. Political squabbling in DC means that both parties are stuck in a battle over Obamacare, but few politicians are focusing on making Obamacare work and keeping the cost of health insurance down.</p><p>There are many small reforms that would help protect jobs and make Obamacare work better, such as permanently eliminating the tax on medical devices, but there are also some big reforms Congress can undertake. For example, we should allow individuals and small businesses to purchase health insurance with pre-tax dollars – the same way big businesses do. This will make health insurance more affordable in the individual market and will place less of a burden on small businesses. </p><p>We should also allow people to purchase health insurance from any company they want – even from another state – just as they purchase auto insurance. This will force health insurance companies to compete, will help lower prices, and will produce better quality products for consumers. </p><p>We need to stop fighting over politics in Washington, and start focusing on results for the American people.</p>",
    "q5":"The American people widely opposed the taxpayer-funded bailouts of 2008. Yet instead of taking steps to make sure taxpayers are never on the hook again, Congress institutionalized taxpayer-funded bailouts by designating companies and institutions as \"SIFIs\" – a fancy acronym for \"too big too fail.\" This only guarantees that big banks will continue to act irresponsibly, knowing that taxpayers will be forced to bail them out once again. </p><p>Instead, Congress should enact clear bankruptcy provisions to allow failing banks to go through the bankruptcy process without destabilizing our economy. Congress should also pass reforms to the housing market, to make sure another housing bubble does not develop. The housing market needs basic lending standards, yet instead taxpayers continue to be on the hook for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.</p>",
    "q6":"President Obama campaigned in 2008 on bringing people together in America. It was an inspiring campaign, but unfortunately, the country is more divisive than ever under his leadership. While President Obama achieved some bipartisan victories, like the JOBS Act, the president has failed to work with Congress on a majority of issues. Instead, the president has relied on executive action to impose wide-ranging laws unilaterally – some of which are now being deemed unconstitutional. That is not how a democracy is supposed to work. </p><p>I also have deep concerns about the country's national defense and foreign policy. The attacks in Paris and San Bernardino make it clear that America and the world face serious terrorists threats, and these threats are not isolated in the Middle East. Unfortunately, the administration has failed to deal with these threats in a serious manner. Instead of taking on ISIS, the administration has taken the opposite approach, rewarding state sponsors of terrorism like Iran.</p>",
    "q7":"Making sure our workers earn more must be a priority. And as the father of three young children, I certainly understand the importance of allowing workers to be there for their families. But I believe that blanket federal regulations could impact our ability to create new and better jobs. I believe it is best to allow each state to decide these kinds of regulatory issues.</p><p>Finally, I believe the best way to increase worker pay is to support policies that encourage more and better-paying jobs. We can change the trajectory we're currently on by enacting policies that encourage job creation instead of stifling it. We need to incentivize entrepreneurship by lowering regulatory barriers that keep small businesses from starting and growing. We also should be offering tax credits to start-ups that create jobs locally and tax incentives to companies to invest in locally sourced innovation.</p>",
    "q8":"Gun violence has resulted in many tragedies across America, and we need to do a better job of preventing these tragedies. There have been many solutions proposed, and while no one solution will prevent all gun violence, we should do what we can to save lives while maintaining our respect for the Second Amendment.</p><p>I believe we can enact commonsense legislation to make sure we keep firearms out of the hands of convicted criminals and the dangerously mentally ill by requiring background checks for firearm transactions that do not involve a licensed firearm dealer. This kind of legislation has been introduced in Congress, but failed to get the necessary votes. I would support a measure like the Toomey-Manchin bill. We also need to do a better job ensuring compliance with National Instant Criminal Background Check System reporting.</p>",
    "q9":"The redistricting process is desperately in need of reform. Legislative districts are meant to be compact in form and composed of adjoining territory. Currently, politicians in Annapolis use the redistricting process for purely political purposes, regardless of how it affects voters. It is imperative that we ensure that voters are being allowed to choose who represents them, as opposed to elected officials being allowed to choose who votes for them. That is neither democratic, nor is it representative of how free elections are meant to work. I support enacting a truly independent commission in Maryland to oversee redistricting, instead of allowing politicians to play political football with the state map.</p>",
    "q10":"As the father of three young children, I want to make Maryland and America a better place for all of us to raise our families. Currently, Washington is mired in political dysfunction. Politicians on both sides of the aisle spend so much time trying to score ideological points, no one gets anything done on issues that affect people in their day-to-day lives -- new and better jobs, an improved education system, access to affordable healthcare, the ability to walk down the street feeling safe, and good and transparent government that we can rely on. I am running for office to focus on getting these important things done for Maryland families.</p>"

I support the Iran nuclear deal, because I believe a nuclear Iran poses the greatest risk to Israeli national security. It's imperative for the international community to unite around an essential objective: halting Iran's nuclear ambitions. The deal is on its way to achieving its goals; it has already pushed Iran further from nuclear weapons capability. Iranians have shut down major reactors and have repurposed other facilities. The deal doesn't mean we can't respond to Iranian aggression and threats. President Obama recently implemented sanctions for ballistic missile tests. The United States should be ready to implement further sanctions immediately if Iran violates its end of the bargain. But there is more that we can do beyond this deal. We should negotiate for more vigorous inspections and continue to apply significant diplomatic pressure on Iran to end their support of terrorists, including Hezbollah. </p>",
    "q2":"ISIS presents a very real threat to the stability of the Middle East and to us here at home. I support President Obama's strategy of arming proxy groups and backing them with air strikes. The United States should also provide intelligence on the ground, including command and control capabilities, especially in places like Syria. This isn't going to wipe out ISIS overnight, but we must defeat them. We also need to focus on the refugees who are fleeing their homes because of the violence. The U.S. should help set up a safe zone along the border with Turkey to house refugees until they can return home or relocate to safer areas. The U.S. should stand ready to stock these zones with supplies refugees need. </p><p>I agree with Hillary Clinton that Donald Trump is ISIS's best recruiter. As someone who has passionately supported the ACLU for years, I'm disgusted by his proposal to violate the Fourth Amendment by putting people under surveillance and to reject refugees because of their religion. It's antithetical to everything we are. It is an insult to every man and woman who has worn our country's uniform and fought for American values. I will vote to keep our doors open to Syrian refugees and oppose any and all Islamophobic proposals from Republican demagogues.</p>",
    "q3":"I support the TPP, because the deal's economic and labor benefits are clear. The TPP gives American businesses and workers new economic opportunities. The agreement will make American-made products more affordable. The Asia-Pacific region offers excellent economic potential for U.S. trade. It will expand opportunities for American businesses overseas by removing taxes and trade barriers on American products abroad. More importantly, it offers protections for workers. In particular, it will allow workers in Vietnam, Malaysia, and Brunei to form independent and legal labor unions. Malaysia's economy will also benefit from the deal's advantages, including an export increase of 20% by 2030. TPP has also received the support of key environmental groups. The World Wildlife Fund and the Nature Conservancy agree that the TPP is some of the best legislation to advance environmental goals and protections. I understand workers' concerns about trade deals; it is why we need strong worker protections and training.</p>",
    "q4":"I'm a big supporter of the Affordable Care Act. The law has been a historic success, allowing over 16 million people access to health care coverage. But there's still a lot of work we need to do to ensure that all Americans have access to quality health care. We must address high deductibles and co-pays. Too many people can only afford plans with high deductibles that discourage them from seeing a doctor when they need to because of those high deductibles and co-pays. It is costly and wrong. Studies show that dealing with medical problems sooner rather than later saves money – for families and for our economy as a whole. It's particularly a problem for mental health services. Too many plans have higher out of pocket costs for these services. I support stricter limits on deductibles and co-pays, so that nobody has to think twice about getting the care they need.</p>",
    "q5":"I applaud the Obama Administration and others who worked to pass Dodd-Frank, but there's no question that we need to do more to reign in the recklessness on Wall Street that nearly brought us to financial ruin. There are several steps we need to take. First, we need to make banking easier for everyone. There are easy things that can be done to increase access to capital, especially for lower income Americans. We can allow banking services in post offices so that people aren't victimized by high banking fees and interest rates. </p><p>Second, the American people overwhelmingly agree that Congress needs to pass tougher regulations on Wall Street. Unfortunately, Congress won't do it because they're accountable to the Wall Street lobbyists who fund their campaigns, not the voters. That's why I'm not taking any money from PACs, lobbyists or corporations, and I don't accept contributions over $10. The only special interests I care about are yours. If we want to change the way the Congress works, we have to change the type of people we send there.</p>",
    "q6":"President Obama has done an extraordinary job under very difficult circumstances. He inherited an economy on the brink of collapse with unemployment rate over 9%. Today, it's down to 5%. One of his greatest accomplishments is the Affordable Care Act, which has brought uninsured rates down to historic lows. We also saw the legalization of marriage for all people during his presidency. It was a historic moment for equal rights. In Congress, I will work to build on President Obama's legacy. It's extremely important that we elect a Democratic President to continue the progress we've made during President Obama's tenure. We need a Congress that will stand with the President on legislation and new Supreme Court Justice appointments.</p>",
    "q7":"We should increase the minimum wage now, so we can begin to address income inequality. But we need to do more. We need to pass a law tying minimum wage to inflation. It's not enough to talk about a specific number if the cost of living continues to rise, and Congress can't work fast enough to meet the needs of American workers. The current minimum wage has certainly not kept pace with the rising cost of living. Higher wages makes good business sense. I know because I've done it, paying my team members more than our competitors. It pays off in the long-run by reducing turnover rates and training costs by making employees more productive. </p><p>Congress absolutely needs to pass guaranteed paid and sick leave. The United States is the only highly developed country that doesn't. Nearly one quarter of Americans do not have guaranteed time off. All employees deserve to have time they can use for sick leave, vacation, or time to take care of family members. It's an economic issue, a family issue, and a moral issue. We need to fix it.</p>",
    "q8":"I support a comprehensive approach to gun control. It disgusts me when I hear about the latest instance of gun violence with no tangible actions from Congress. Thoughts and prayers alone are simply not enough to protect Americans. Only strong regulation and increased gun safety will stop the senseless violence.</p><p>I've made a career out of fighting against entrenched interests and winning. I intend to take on the Gun Lobby in the same way. The only way to beat a bully is to stand up to them. And I will. Their influence has cost us too many lives, especially the deaths of young people that could have been prevented. I strongly support legislation that bans access to assault weapons and expands gun safety regulations. We need to bring back the Federal Assault Weapons Ban, expand background checks, tighten regulation of the gun dealers, and require safe firearm storage in homes. We also need to close loopholes from private sales, including gun shows. </p><p>I applaud President Obama's Executive Action in 2016; it will actually create jobs and keep Americans safe. But Congress needs to step up and do more. Sensible gun laws work all over the world. We need sensible politicians who can pass legislation that protects their constituents. </p>p>",
    "q9":"Voters should pick their representatives, not the other way around. We absolutely need election reform. Gerrymandering is both a national and a local problem that greatly distorts representation in Congress and is a fundamental cause of political gridlock. Both parties are to blame. It's a fundamentally self-serving system for incumbents. Maryland is the second most gerrymandered state in the country. I believe that the Democratic Party is with the people on the issues, and I'm confident that we can win on our ideals, not by exerting our electoral power. </p><p>I support an independent redistricting commission so that all voters are represented in government. Politicians cannot be responsible for fair redistricting. With today's technology, we can easily create sensible boundaries and have an effective districting system that benefits all constituents.</p>",
    "q10":"I'm running for Congress, because I'm frustrated by do-nothing legislators who spend more time on shouting competitions than on solving the serious problems we face. I'm running to fix an organization that has 14% approval but somehow re-elects 96% of its members. I'm running, because working families and small businesses are struggling more than ever to have their voices heard in a place that seems to do a lot more talking than listening. I've spent my career in business solving problems, being innovative, and working with anyone who could help get things done. We don't have enough of that in Congress, and I'm running to change it. </p><p>I've been successful in business, because we've focused on our consumers. We've brought the right people together to serve them. We need more of that in Washington. We can't think about the next election or the next poll like Wall Street thinks about the next quarter or daily stock quote. We need to think long-term and about the next generation. We need to solve issues instead of just talking about them. We need to actually create change instead of just proposing it. That's what has made me successful in business, and it's why I want to bring that same approach to end the gridlock in Washington. </p>"
