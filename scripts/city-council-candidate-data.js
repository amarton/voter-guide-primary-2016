    "q1":"Early Childhood Education: Too many families in the First District leave once they have kids. I believe that Universal Pre-Kindergarten would be a powerful inducement to keep families in the city. Economist James Heckman has shown that every dollar spent on early childhood education yields six dollars in reducing incarceration and welfare dependency. Early childhood education helps close the academic achievement gap and can keep middle class families in the city.</p><p>Fiscal accountability: I run a non profit. Every year I get audited. If I misspend any money my organization gets shut down. Why is it that our city is operating with no regular audits? Having been a teacher, I am deeply concerned that money gets lost at North Ave, and in </p><p>Community policing: we need to see our officers out of their cars engaging with our community. We need to shift recruitment practices and reach out to more Baltimore City residents to become officers. We need to enhance training to include best practices around cultural competence and implicit bias. We need to shift the metric of success away from arrests made, to citizen satisfaction. </p><p>Finally, I would like to see a more walkable and bikable First District. We should develop in a way that puts pedestrians first. We should follow the Baltimore Bike master plan and build bike lanes. We also need to improve our public transit so that less people use their cars. Parking and congestion are problems in the First District.</p>",
    "q2":"I believe that we have an enormous amount of work to do to shift the relationship between officers and the communities they serve. When I taught in Sandtown, I personally witnessed several incidents of officers getting rough with my middle school students. When I spoke to a sergeant about this recently, he told me that the younger officers were brought up in a culture that rewarded aggressive policing. He told me that we are still \"crawling our way out of zero-tolerance. Many of the young guys need to be trained how to walk a beat, and talk to people.\" That is a sad state of affairs.</p><p>That said, I believe Commissioner Davis is on the right track. I appreciate his commitment to foot patrol and community policing. He seems to understand that unless citizens, and particularly citizens of color become partners with the police, we will not be able to solve violent crime. I think it is still too early to tell whether his emphasis on \"post\" based policing will be effective.</p><p>Violent crime is still unacceptably high. I would continue to fund and expand evidence backed programs like Safe Streets. I would also like to see an expanded emphasis on treating drug addiction as a public health issue instead of criminality. I am encouraged by the partnership of BCPD, OSI and the Health Department.</p>",
    "q3":"The lesson I draw is that we can either invest in our young people now, or pay the consequences later. The day after the Unrest took place, my students and I held a \"Day of Listening.\" Over two hundred people came together to share ideas on how we could improve the city. Over and over again young people said that they felt like their voices were not being heard. They felt like the city had turned it's back on them. They spoke about rec centers closed, and promises broken. They spoke about the deteriorating condition of our schools. They spoke about systems being fundamentally broken. It is time that we listened to our young people.</p><p>I believe that we need to start by passing the Youth Investment Act. 3% is a relatively modest investment in our young people, but it's an important first step. I believe that we need universal pre-Kindergarten. We know that kid's brains are developing earlier and earlier. We need to rebuild the PAL Centers, and stop closing Rec Centers. </p><p>Overall, I think that the Unrest was symptomatic of a much deeper sickness. Our public policies have demonstrated a consistent disdain for our youth, and they have taken notice. The work ahead is about rebuilding trust. It is also about giving young people a voice in how we rebuild. They cannot continue to be ignored.</p>",
    "q4":"I believe that the current property tax structure is inequitable and prevents working and middle class people from purchasing a home. I favor a gradual reduction in property taxes coupled with a significant effort to recoup revenue from slum and absentee landlords. I think the city should use all tools at it's disposal including Vacants to Value and eminent domain to make it difficult for people to continue to sit on vacant properties. </p><p>In terms of development, I believe that the City Council and Mayor must be better advocates for citizens. We should demand enforcement of local hiring and PLA's (Project Labor Agreements) when we give out subsidies. I also think that we should be more strategic in leveraging TIF's and PILOT's to spur development in areas that otherwise could not be built. Our state representatives should amend the Geographic Cost of Educational Indexing formula so that our schools do not lose revenue when we provide tax incentives. Overall, I think that tax breaks for development should only be given to developers that value our communities by hiring local, unionized and living wage labor.</p>",
    "q5":"Baltimore can encourage commercial and residential revitalization by investing in people first. That means building high quality community schools. Creating tax incentives for public sector employees that chose to live in distressed neighborhoods. That means having universal pre-Kindergarten so that working parents can get back to work. That means strengthening the relationship between officers and the residents they serve. </p><p>Specifically, I think that we should aggressively fine people that sit on vacant, dilapidated or poor maintained property. If that doesn't work to shift behavior, then Baltimore should use eminent domain. I think the evidence on Vacants to Values is mixed in terms of it's overall impact, but I think it is a good tool that we should continue to use to induce revitalization. </p><p>I am encouraged that Governor Hogan has taken an interest in combatting blight, but the project will not be successful unless it truly provides uplift to our communities. During the time I taught in Sandtown there was significant investment in fixing up blighted housing. But it didn't work. It failed because the people living there were still unemployed. They still felt marginalized and disenfranchised. Drug dealing and police brutality did not subside. I hope that the Governor's program begins with the premise that we put Baltimore people to work. The first people to be hired for these reconstruction jobs should be city residents. We should hire unionized folks, as well as returning citizens. We should also engage communities to determine comes next.</p>",
    "q6":"There are several barriers to economic development and job creation:</p><p>Schools: Our schools are not producing 21st Century job ready graduates. When I taught in Sandtown, many of the children entering into six grade still couldn't read. I would like to see universal pre-K, expansion of community schools, and a new emphasis on the trades within our high school. We should do an analysis of the types of jobs that are going to be available in the next ten years and create schools to match that portfolio.</p><p>Returning citizens: Because of the failed War on Drugs and Zero Tolerance Policing, far too many of our citizens have criminal records and cannot find work. As Councilman, I would create a tax incentive for businesses that hire returning citizens. I would also push our unions to invest training capacity into returning citizens. </p><p>Bureaucracy: I have spent a lot of time listening to small businesses in the First District. They believe that the permitting process is mired in red tape. We should make it easier for people to start businesses in Baltimore. I would eliminate some of the minor privilege fees, and work on modernizing the permitting process. </p><p>Youth jobs: We should incentivize businesses through a tax credit to hire youth. I would also like to see the Mayor's Office of Economic Development start offering young people \"green jobs\" like they do in Howard County.</p>",
    "q7":"The current balance of power tilts too heavily toward the mayor. I would revive Councilman Henry's bill to allow the council to override the mayor's veto with just 2/3 instead of 3/4 votes. I would also introduce legislation to allow the Council to add money to the budget, instead of just being able to take out money. Finally, I would consider changing the Board of Estimates to only give one vote to the mayor. </p><p>I believe that the city is ready for a new alignment of power. But with that increased power comes a responsibility to talk to each other across lines of difference. The Council cannot continue to be a provincial body, where Members only advocate for projects in their own District. We need to start looking out for each other and recognizing that if I help get a rec center built in the 13th, that will help my constituents in the 1st because they may use it.</p>",
    "q8":"I believe the single most important piece of legislation to come out of the City Council in the last four years was Ban the Box. That legislation took courage. It gave returning citizens a foot in the door in the job hiring process. I also liked Councilman Scott's legislation to give public grades to restaurants. Other than that, I have not seen many bold ideas coming out of the Council. </p><p>I would like to see a City Council that shows true leadership on issues impacting the City. Council Members should be leading on affordable housing, school reform, police accountability, youth programming, job creation and other issues vital to Baltimore's well being. Too often the Council has been reactive instead of proactive. If we want to avoid another period of unrest, we need to respond directly to our citizens and push for legislation that addresses some of the route causes of the ills facing our city. I believe that the City Council can be a vehicle for positive transformation across the city, but we need to organize with our constituents and colleagues.</p>",
    "q9":"In the First District, we have significant issues with trash collection, street sweeping and getting the basics right. The result is that we have some neighborhoods that look terrible. We know this leads to blight and crime. </p><p>I also think that we need to improve schools and public transit. While the state technically controls the MTA and runs the school system in partnership with the Mayor, I think we need to do a better job of being actual partners. I would like to see the City take the lead on Governor Hogan's new City Link strategy and come up with a plan that actually makes sense for our citizens. I'd like to see us expand the Circulator. I'd like to see the City create partnerships between our schools and the Health Department, Police Department, Housing Department and other city agencies. </p><p>Overall, I think that many of the inefficiencies are caused by a lack of coordination between agencies. I would make sure that our agencies are working closely together and sharing data and ideas.</p>",
    "q10":"As a former teacher, and current Executive Director of a youth leadership non profit, I believe that Baltimore can be great. We have incredible communities made up of gritty, resilient, brilliant and loving citizens. We need a city government that matches the excellence of it's citizenry. Right now, city hall is part of the problem. I am running because I've watched young people struggle in ways they shouldn't have to. I'm running because so many of our civic institutions are broken, and I believe it will take a new voice to fix them. </p><p>I will be a Councilman that invests in our youth. I will be a Councilman that listens and responds to his constituents. I will be a Councilman that is accessible and accountable. I will build community across the First District, and with my colleagues in other parts of the city.</p>"

    "q1":"As the 1st District City Councilmember, I would be representing some of the most diverse neighborhoods in Baltimore City. The concerns of our residents are also varied but some of the most pressing issues include improving public safety, reducing the tax burden on families and business owners, and greater efficiency from our city government. </p><p>There's no doubt our city has great challenges ahead but we also can come together to achieve great things again. We deserve a government that works and is accountable to the people. Residents deserve lower crime, lower taxes and more accountability from our City leaders and Departments. We can lower crime by returning to crime strategies that worked, incorporating more community policing and funding private security in our neighborhoods. </p><p>We can reduce property taxes but reducing and eliminating in some instances non-profit exemptions thereby increasing total property tax revenues. We should also require all agencies to submit annual requests using zero-based budgeting. Finally, we can reform city government by enforcing audits for all city agencies, giving parents real school choice such as public funding of charter schools, private school vouchers and home-schooling consortium. </p>",
    "q2":"No, Baltimore is not pursuing the right strategies. I have little confidence in the current leadership. We must implement a multi-prong approach in order to reduce crime and increase the trust in our police department. Not only should Baltimore should require police to be visibly present in our communities engaging with residents but we should fund coordinated citizens-on-patrol efforts. Additionally, we should restore funding for Police Athletic Leagues to serve as after-school centers. </p><p>But, the police department must also return to effective police strategies such as re-centralizing the Warrant Apprehension Task Force. Under Anthony Batts, officers with specialized expertise were removed from the centralized unit. As a result, the 1st District has seen an increase in robberies and burglaries because people with open warrants can continue to commit crimes. We should restore the Task Force to get the bad guys off of our streets. I support the police officers that work hard to protect our community, but we should also invest matching public funds with communities that desire private security in their neighborhoods. </p><p>Finally, we must also hold criminals accountable and I support mandatory community service for all first-time nonviolent offenders including cleaning streets and public parks but also provided access to supportive services. Early intervention is key to stopping the cycle of progressive criminal activity committed by repeat offenders. Only by working together, can we heal our city. But we must clearly articulate to criminals that the days of lawlessness are over.</p>",
    "q3":"The death of Freddie Gray was a senseless and preventable tragedy. It exposed bare for the entire world to see decades of failed city leadership, from the mayor to the police department. Under previous mayors and city councils, pervasive crime, inequality, and diminished outcomes and opportunities became the norm. As well as a culture of accepting crime in Baltimore City as the new norm. </p><p>For decades, our city began to expect less from children not based on their potential, but based on their neighborhood and zip code. My family immigrated to this city decades ago and I remember the challenges our city faced in the 80s and 90s with the increase of the drug trade. Under former Mayor O'Malley we adopted a tough on crime approach, with mixed results. Cuts were made to vocational training programs which provided jobs and opportunities to all the residents in our city. </p><p>I will work to address any tension between communities of color and the police, and work to ensure that the racial, ethnic makeup of our police force reflects the diversity of our city's neighborhoods. </p>",
    "q4":"Baltimore has the highest property taxes in the State. Coupled with high levels of crime and some of the lowest performing public schools; it's no wonder that people leave the City or worse - decide against moving here. In order to be competitive with surrounding jurisdictions, Baltimore must reduce taxes and onerous fees on families and business owners. </p><p>We're not competitive on property taxes and have not had an attractive business climate for over six-decades. That's why I'm calling for a significant reduction in property taxes for homeowners to make Baltimore City competitive to attract and retain homeowners. As a City Councilmember, I would advocate for a 50% reduction in property taxes implemented gradually over four years. </p><p>Opponents to an aggressive reduction in the property tax rate argue that doing so is a gamble. I reject that assertion and posit that we must have faith in our city and not doubt the dynamic effect of potential investors. A gradual approach prepares the City to balance the budget even with projected losses in tax revenues. However, it requires the City to be critical in our annual spending, tightening our belts, increase scrutiny in our allocations, and prove our seriousness in changing the direction of our City once and for all. </p><p>I would also advocate shortening the terms of public subsidies included in development deals and closing some tax loopholes. Using models found in Virginia; Baltimore should reduce and in some cases, eliminate, the property tax exemption for some non-profit organizations.</p>",
    "q5":"Revitalization efforts will not be realized in neighborhoods away from the waterfront absent any real demand in the real estate market. I believe Baltimore City should plan mixed-use and mixed-income development efforts to revitalize neighborhoods in areas with large concentrations of vacant or blighted properties. But most investors - whether developers or individual home buyers - are interested in not just the real estate options and related costs, but also in the quality of life associated with the neighborhood. In lieu of focusing development efforts only in the City's most affluent or impoverished neighborhoods, we should implement planned development adjacent to neighborhoods with less than 10% vacant properties within proximity of public transportation hubs. This transit-oriented approach would allow for increased interest in otherwise stable neighborhoods while capitalizing on existing public transportation systems. </p><p>The Vacants to Value program is not working. The properties are not desirable especially at market rate. I advocate for a return to the sale of municipal owned properties for $1 with an increase monitoring of renovation completion within established guidelines. </p><p>I strongly support Governor Hogan's recent efforts to provide funding in an effort to remove blight, provide green space, and attract investment in our most challenged communities. </p>",
    "q6":"The chief barriers to economic development and job creation are attributed to a failed public education system coupled with a lack of trade industries to compete with the illicit drug trade. </p><p>The path to removing barriers to economic development across Baltimore is linked to providing better public education choices for parents such as publicly funding charter schools, private school vouchers and home-schooling consortiums; reducing the tax burden to residents and business owners; and streamlining of all city agencies and departments. </p><p>Baltimore should return to promoting vocational training in every public high school so all children are ready for the workforce or college upon graduation. We should work directly with building trade unions such as welders, carpenters, and electricians to fund training and a direct pipeline to employment in high schools.</p><p>We also need to continue supporting job-creating private redevelopment projects across Baltimore, such as Amazon, Canton Crossing, and Under Armour's Port Covington project, the expansion of the ship and rail capacity at the port, and similar initiatives to bring jobs and families to the city. This multi-faceted approach is needed to reverse the decades long downward population trend in Baltimore, foster a well-educated workforce and restore its position as the economic engine of Maryland. </p>",
    "q7":"Baltimore City has one of the strongest mayoral structures in the country. The Mayor essentially controls the Board of Estimates with two votes carried by mayoral appointees; the council can only override executive action with a super-majority; and council members are not able to increase or add new line items to the annual budget. </p><p>I support current legislation to remove the two mayoral appointees and reduce the size of membership on the Board of Estimates to include the Mayor, Comptroller, City Council President and a rotating schedule for two members of the Baltimore City Council distributed evenly throughout the fiscal year. My proposed structure would increase transparency on the Board of Estimates by allowing council members an equal opportunity to review, approve or deny proposed City spending, ask clarifying questions of agency/department heads and interested parties seeking the City's business, and represent the interest of their constituents. </p><p>I also would advocate a change to Baltimore City Charter that allows for a simple-majority of three-fifths of the City Council to override a mayoral veto. Finally, I would support legislation incorporating term limits for all local elected officials. </p>",
    "q8":"Recently the Baltimore City Council has been focused on legislating behavior of its constituents that often failed to produce the intended changes or worse - only increased the financial burden on residents and businesses. In short order, the City Council passed legislation to increase the cost of plastic bags, styrofoam cups, and bottled beverages; required businesses to offer employment prior to full knowledge of the candidate's background, and even taxed the rain. </p><p>That is the wrong approach to governing and not the right focus. However, the most important issue the City Council has addressed in the last four years is rejecting the $6.4 million settlement with Freddie Gray's family unless the mayor separating the legal fees for outside lawyers to acts as defense counsel in the Department of Justice investigation. </p><p>This action demonstrated the Council's fiscal restraint and reinforced the desire to implement changes within the police department instead of blocking recommendations. </p>",
    "q9":"The delivery of city services are often inefficient, provided without concern for customer service and desperately require modernization. From antiquated code enforcement and health inspection practices that include paper copies to often-broken electronic parking meters to trash collection leaving more debris in our streets and alleys than in the trash truck; our government needs to invest in providing efficient services, improved emphasis on customer service and incorporate technology within our budget. </p><p>Online customer service systems such as 311 are a start in improving response time and satisfaction but we could also incorporate mobile parking apps; modernizing city agencies to allow for real time enforcement reducing the need for employees to return to their offices draft reports, and holding employees to a higher standard of public service. </p><p>Additionally, the police department leases vehicles – costing approximately $1,000 each month per vehicle– from another city agency, the Department of Public Works. That's correct: one city agency pays another city agency. Additionally, the Police Department is prohibited from outsourcing routine maintenance or repairs to vehicles even though the market rate is considerably cheaper. This practice costs the City approximately millions annually. Instead of gradually downsizing the unit through attrition or upgrading the skill sets of employees to be consistent with labor market demands; our government continues this inefficient practice. As a City Council member, I would highlight this inefficient and wasteful policy and fight to make budget policies that were more efficient and in the best interest of the citizens.</p>",
    "q10":"I'm running for city council because our city deserves real leadership and an independent voice on the city council. For far too long we've accepted the status quo as City Hall has taken more of our hard-earned dollars and in exchange we've seen fewer city services, such as the closing of recreation centers and fire stations, a crumbling infrastructure, our kids sweltering in the heat without working air conditioning in school and less of the peoples' business being addressed. It's unacceptable and I'm running because we can do better. </p><p>My job is to expand opportunity, and we're going to achieve that by doing things differently.</p>"

    "q1":"Transportation, crime and safety, and education. The fact is, we need to do a better job of keeping families and businesses in Baltimore. I believe a transit system would help connect economically-depressed areas around the city to potential employers, reduce the traffic congestion and parking problems that plague District 1, and help attract new investment to the City. However, first and foremost, we must make all city residents feel respected, safe, and valued. We also need to incentivize a strong community-police relationship and an open and honest dialogue. In addition to making it easier to get around the city and feeling safe in all of our neighborhoods, we must make it viable for younger families to make a long term commitment to our community with a strong public education system. As a proud product of the public education system, I will work to strengthen our neighborhood public schools and implement creative education NGOs and technologies to supplement our student's educational experience. I will also work to make sure our schools get the funding that they need to create multiple pathways to success for our students. We have the resources in Baltimore to implement strong and creative internship and apprenticeship programs to provide exciting opportunities for students to stay in the city and contribute to the global economy.</p>",
    "q2":"2015 was the deadliest year in Baltimore's history. We have to do more to prevent violent crime and protect our community. I believe we need a strong focus on a real crime strategy and a strong City Council to help implement it. Due to last years' tragic unrest, Baltimore has access to resources and relationships at the Department of Justice that could be used to develop an effective crime prevention program for our city. In order to proactively make our city better, I believe we need to focus on cracking down on domestic abusers, preventing our youth from being exposed to violence at home, and enhance the punishments for gun traffickers. We also must change our \"broken windows\" mindset to policing. Instead of cracking down on those around the broken window, let's fix the window! This includes increasing the funding for job retraining programs to help our residents compete in a rapidly changing global economy. We need to also change our police model to make it community-focused. I think Commissioner Davis is on the right track in this regard and applaud the recent efforts at creating a mediation system between officers and possible victims of abuse. However, I think there is more that needs to be done to remove officers that are consistent offenders.</p>",
    "q3":"The most glaring issue the unrest exposed is that we have two Baltimores. One Baltimore, including District 1, is experiencing a renaissance of development, population growth, and exciting new industries and opportunities in technology and medicine. The second Baltimore is losing population and is lacking in economic opportunities. I believe a well-planned and executed public transportation system could enhance the relationship between the two Baltimores, expand opportunities for all residents, and spark development in areas that are neglected by investors. At the same time, we must do a better job of equipping our workers and students with the skills they need to compete in the global economy. For too long, we have watched as manufacturing jobs and families have left Baltimore. My main platform in this campaign is to help keep families and businesses in Baltimore. As Councilmember, I will advocate for funding for job training programs for our workers and will work to create exciting apprenticeship and internship opportunities so students of all backgrounds can gain experience in some of the exciting economic development that is happening around our city.</p>",
    "q4":"Yes. I believe that our current tax rate deters residents from moving to our city and incentivizes homeowners to leave. As Councilman, I will work to make our city services better and will support initiatives to lower property taxes for our city's homeowners. I think Baltimore needs to get more value for its hard earned tax dollars. It's great that large employers want to come to our city, but we must ensure that the benefits of these agreements are widely shared. I would support agreements that earmark dollars to develop all of our neighborhoods, not just the waterfront. I would support agreements, particularly in District 1, that earmark funds to transportation and parking to ease the burden of high-density development on current residents. These solutions will ensure we're getting value for our tax dollars.</p>",
    "q5":"I believe our TIF agreements should include requirements or incentives to spur development in all of our neighborhoods. As we have seen in recent years, public investment in our neighborhoods is not sufficient to create sustainable growth and value without long-term private investment and positive community anchors. I would also support agreements to put aside funds for job training programs. We are blessed in District 1 with a burgeoning tech industry, but many of our residents are struggling to compete for these jobs. Let's put these new dollars into Baltimore to spur development that benefits the whole city. I think the Vacants to Value program has been successful. Around District 1, we've seen Patterson Park revitalized with new homeowners and entrepreneurs utilizing this program to create a thriving, safe, and growing area that welcomes all neighbors - old and new. I think we must do more than revitalize the homes and neighborhoods that can be seen from Amtrak. While I support any engagement from Annapolis, I think we can and should come up with more creative solutions in our local government.</p>",
    "q6":"I think our chief barrier to development is a lack of local, skilled employees. We must devise new solutions to retrain workers so they can compete in the global economy and bring good jobs to Baltimore, as well as better utilize the internship and apprenticeship programs that currently exist. While jobs like those at the Amazon Warehouse are great, we also need to help our residents prepare for the new employers that are moving into the city. The second piece is that our city residents are struggling with a lack of access to educational and professional opportunities. The current public transportation system has the unfortunate consequence of creating a divided city. A 21st Century network of mass transit options that utilizes the unique geography and population of Baltimore could be a true agent of change for our city and make our city jobs accessible to all of our city residents.</p>",
    "q7":"I do not believe the current balance is appropriate. Our City Council is the closest body of government to the people, yet it is dominated by the Mayorship. As Councilman, I will work with our Council President to utilize the Council's subpoena powers in order to hold our city government accountable. As we've seen with the recent audits of city department, or the lack thereof, our agencies need stronger and more forceful oversight on behalf of the people. As an attorney, I will act as an advocate for my constituents and hold our agencies more accountable to the results and goals promised by our local government.</p>",
    "q8":"Yes and No. I was proud to see the Council, and our State, take a tough political vote to implement Stormwater Management Fees. I've read many stories on our city politicians promoting our Healthy Harbor Plan and the catchy \"swimmable by 2020\" line. It is great to see us make a commitment to our harbor, but we still have a long way to go to actually implement this goal. As Councilman, I will take this task seriously. Baltimore depends on a healthy Bay for our port, continued business investment, and our growing tourism industry. Without a Healthy Harbor there is no Baltimore. However, I was not satisfied to see our Council fail to address many of the other important issues in our city. The Council continues to cave to pressure from developers for TIF financing. While I think TIF's can often be an appropriate and creative approach to spur much-needed investment, we need to do a better job of ensuring that real contributions are made to ease traffic congestion, particularly in District 1, and that the character of our walkable and mostly public waterfront is not radically altered. We also need to ensure that the benefits of these programs are shared among all communities and not simply those that abut the waterfront.</p>",
    "q9":"I see the weaknesses in our city services every single day on the streets of District 1. I see trash that is not collected on time. Some resident have even solicited City employees to pay them to collect trash. I hear stories from residents in north Highlandtown and around Patterson Park about illegal auto parts businesses operating around their neighborhoods and stealing parts from parked cars. I see police officers sitting in their cars instead of proactively engaging with the community on their beats. We need to change the culture of our city services. With the highest property taxes in the area, we are simply not seeing the value for our hard earned tax dollars. First and foremost, I would support proposals to moderately decrease property taxes to ease the burden our city families. I would also utilize the Council's subpoena powers to hold departments accountable for continued issues. I support the Mayor's initiatives of trash collection and pest control, but believe these quality of life issues need more funding and attention.</p>",
    "q10":"As a boy in South Africa during the 1990s, I witnessed a desperate need for transformative leadership. I had the privilege of being able to see Nelson Mandela take a society that was broken, and put it back together. Fast forward to the present, I am a Canton homeowner, an attorney, and Maryland law graduate that owes everything I have to this city that gave me the ability to succeed. I am running because Baltimore needs new leadership. We have in Baltimore the opportunity to become a first class city for transportation and to be a hub for entrepreneurship in Central Maryland. The City Council is the epicenter of where all of this innovation begins. I am running for City Council to create exciting transportation solutions for our city that connect residents of all economic backgrounds to employment centers. I am running to create a safe environment for our citizens, while ensuring there is respect and dialogue between our communities and law enforcement. And, I am running for City Council to stop our families and businesses from leaving the city when we need their resources and investment in order to grow and develop.</p>"

    "q1":"I'm campaigning for (1) safe neighborhoods, (2) strong schools, and (3) smart development strategies and property tax reform.</p><p>Safe Neighborhoods: I support the transition to a community-policing model to build trust between the police and community. From new schedules, to new training, to basic technology upgrades like putting computers in police vehicles, I will be an advocate on the Council for this new approach.</p><p>Strong Schools: I have a nine-month-old son who I hope one day will attend Baltimore City Schools. What I hear over and over again from teachers and principals in our schools is that they are succeeding despite the bureaucracy of North Avenue. I support oversight and reform to (1) create better incentives and training for teachers and principals; (2) making it the standard for schools to become \"Community Schools\"; and (3) keeping the 21st Century Schools Construction plan on track.</p><p>Smart Development and Property Tax Reform. We should maintain the exciting growth in Southeast Baltimore but do so in a smart way, planning ahead for how development impacts education, transportation, parking, and our green space. We also need to experiment with progressive tax reform – such as property tax penalties on vacant and blighted property – to lower our property taxes and reduce blight.</p>",
    "q2":"I believe that Baltimore's best days are ahead, and they will be achieved by rebuilding the trust between our police and residents. That starts with standardized patrol assignments and increased outreach from Baltimore Police Department (BPD) to citizens and businesses.</p><p>I support the current leadership in the BPD and Commissioner Davis's efforts to transition the culture of policing in the City from a \"warrior\" to a \"guardian\" approach. </p><p>As a former prosecutor and current community-policing advocate who is dedicated to building trust between the police and our neighborhoods, I know the Baltimore Police Department has systemic, structural problems to address. Too many officers patrolling the streets feel under siege and too many of our citizens do not trust the people sworn to protect them. If elected, I will ensure the City Council provides strong oversight of the BPD and ensure that we successfully transition to the community-policing model through partnership and communication with our neighborhoods.</p>",
    "q3":"Whether you call it the unrest, or the riots, or the uprising, I remember April 27, 2015, as the night my wife and I realized that we would not be able to get to a hospital when she was eight and a half months pregnant. The divisions, injustice, and disorder in our City led to the violence that night, and the first lesson I take from it was that we – as neighbors, community leaders, and proud Baltimoreans – have the responsibility to make sure it doesn't happen again. We have to reform our police tactics, address systemic poverty and racism, end lead poisoning, and face the historic cultural divides in our city.</p><p>I was – and I am – angry that a human being died in police custody in America in the twenty-first century. As a veteran, I'm proud to have served a country where people have the right to peacefully assemble to protest in a unified voice. As a former prosecutor, I believe all parties are entitled to a fair and impartial trial. As a community-policing advocate, I want to ensure we use this moment to reform our policing tactics and rebuild trust between our communities and the police. </p><p>Unfortunately, tragedies like this remind us all of the divide within our community between those who trust the police to protect and those who fear the motivations of all law enforcement. </p><p>Despite it all, as someone who still believes in progress, I'm hopeful for the future.</p>",
    "q4":"Baltimore needs progressive tax reform to lower our property taxes. Baltimore will never compete as a city for new residents and businesses when our taxes are twice as high as that of our neighbors. Baltimore, with the support of the State legislature, should pilot tiered tax rates for vacant property. Washington, D.C., for example, institutes a 5% property tax penalty on vacant property and a 10% penalty on blighted property. Other cities also tax land and improvements at different rates in order to incentivize turning over vacant property and reward improving one's property. Baltimore's needs more affordable housing and business property and also has a booming stock of vacant property. Experimenting with progressive property tax reform could unlock market forces to encourage redevelopment.</p><p>I support the limited use of payments in lieu of taxes (PILOTs) and tax increment financing (TIFs) as part of a smart development approach to encourage construction and renovation that would otherwise not occur in economically challenged parts of the City. But we need to leverage these incentives to bring more family-sustaining construction work, green space, and affordable housing through our agreements with developers. </p><p>Most importantly, the City's goal must be to lower property taxes for all, so that more families choose to move to Baltimore and stay here for a lifetime.</p>",
    "q5":"First, we have to make our City government more effective so that neighborhoods across this City enjoy a sense of progress and functionality that is now missing. Second, we should begin progressive tax reforms (discussed in my answer to question four) to reward property owners for maintaining their homes and discourage vacancy and blight. Third, we should continue the Vacants-to-Value program with targeted enforcement of challenged properties or areas. This program has had successes so far, but it could be even more transformative with effective tax reform. Fourth, and finally, I welcome the Governor's recent proposal of $700 million worth of demolition and development incentives, but I am concerned that his budget appears to simply repackage old programs rather than provide new money and ideas. It will be necessary for the City Council, the Mayor, and our State delegation to make sure this program is not just a paper promise.</p>",
    "q6":"The chief barrier to economic development and job creation in Baltimore is the dysfunctionality and bureaucracy of city government. I've met too many business owners in the First District who have said that if given the chance to do it over again, they would not start a business here. From inefficient permitting processes, to arbitrary enforcement against people and workers doing the right things, to the sense that only the well-connected can get anything done, these barriers are of our own creation. I believe when we govern right, economic growth will follow. </p><p>Our residents are our greatest resource and there is no government benefit that can compete with a family-supporting job. The City and State must leverage all of its available resources to ensure that every child receives a high-quality K-12 education. Moreover, we must work with our partners in Annapolis to ensure students receive a high-quality education at Baltimore City Community College and our local universities. And for the men and women seeking to make an investment in their future later in life, we need to ensure that continuing adult education, GED courses, and ESOL classes are accessible and affordable. </p><p>Finally, our transportation system is woefully inadequate to move Baltimoreans between the jobs they have now, let alone the jobs we hope to create in the future. The City Council and Mayor must work with our State delegation to improve and reform MTA service and ensure the Governor's B-Link program creates meaningful transit options for all residents.</p>",
    "q7":"A lesson I learned in the Army is that power and authority do not always line up. It is true that the City Council is structurally weak in comparison to the Mayor. I will seek to rebalance this relationship by giving the City Council a significant role in the budgeting process and reducing the veto override number from three-quarters of Council Members to two-thirds. But the focus on structural power in this debate misses the point that the Council has authority it does not use. Regardless of any structural changes in the Mayor-Council relationship, I plan to use my position on the Council to exercise oversight, bring critical issues to light, and build real partnerships with City agencies and personnel.</p>",
    "q8":"I applaud the City Council's important legislative achievements over the past four years, including expanding the Community Schools program, adopting new building codes to promote green construction, requiring more local hiring on publicly supported development projects, and requiring audits that will be essential to making our city government work again. </p><p>The next City Council has to take this work to the next level, making the Community Schools program the standard in Baltimore, adopting new approaches to smart development, and using the results of audits to streamline and improve city services.</p>",
    "q9":"Improving City services is the central goal of my campaign. If you talk with anyone who has lived in Baltimore for more than 50 years, they will tell you about a time when things just seemed to work – in contrast to what we have now. Baltimoreans don't expect the Mayor to drive around the City at 3:00 am every night, calling in potholes (a story people still tell about Mayor Schaefer). But we do expect a greater sense of urgency and progress in the problems we report.</p><p>We can't make progress in our City's challenges until we know where our residents' tax dollars are going. To make city government work again, I would start by completing the audits of city agencies and making audits routine for all agencies. We also need to change the culture in city government from one concerned with credit, blame, and political appearances to one driven by a desire to get things done. Baltimore 311 is also a remarkable system that could transform how the city functions. But how many times does a 311 ticket close without explanation or adequate investigation? Finally, we must continue to revive CitiStat, which has languished until recently. </p>",
    "q10":"Not long after I came home from Afghanistan in 2014, a city water pipe burst under the street in front of our house. I assumed that in America in the twenty-first century, I could call the City and someone would come fix it. Instead, I got three months of every kind of government dysfunction imaginable. Meanwhile, our basement flooded and the street cracked. </p><p>Compounded by the systemic challenges we face, from public education, to public justice, access to family-supporting jobs, disinvestment, blight, and historical cultural inequities, I realized that my experience with City Hall was only a symptom of a much larger problem. </p><p>With the support of my family, friends, and neighbors, I decided to run for City Council to tackle government dysfunction and work to make our communities safer and stronger for all families. </p><p>I will bring the skills, discipline, and temperament needed to get things done for the people of the First District. </p>"

    "q1":"Development / Transportation: they both go hand in hand. We need smart development but not over development. We need to protect the Historic neighborhood of Fells Point and other areas from being overdeveloped. Buildings that are 60 to 100 ft in height do not belong in a historic, 250yr old neighborhood, which is currently planned in the new Transform Baltimore zoning regulations. I watched how my parents protested in the 1960's to save Fells Point from the dreaded highway; we need proper infrastructure before we continue with major developments. There are too many vehicles in Fells Point and not enough friendly bike lanes and walk lanes that were suggested in the Fells Point Master plan. </p><p>School Improvement: we need more city and state budget funding to go towards city schools and more accountability from North Ave, HQ. In the 1st district, Wolfe Academy, I consider it a model school. The school is a converted charter school which is unique in itself. The population of the school is about 90% minority but the school is ranked 2nd in academic just behind the Roland Park school. Community groups, residents and businesses work hand in hand with this school to make this school a better school. </p><p>City Services: while the 311 system works well, it works well with minor issues. With major issues we need more accountability and supervision. . Crime/Safety issues; more community policing is needed and support of small businesses by reducing the minor privilege tax burden.</p>",
    "q2":"Yes... Baltimore is pursuing the right strategies. I have total confidence with the new police commissioner. We need more community policing and more in-service training. We need to identify mental health issues when individuals are involved with the police. The LEAD program I believe will work well in Baltimore as it has done so in Seattle with respect to non-violent offenders. Zero tolerance is not the answer; identification of mental health issues along with both drug and alcohol addiction is a key factor in today's law enforcement strategy. We need aggressive police work when it comes to violent offenders and with repeat offenders. Operation Cease Fire is a good program when the city and federal agencies are involved but it must be an on-going program. Drug Trafficking Organizations, DTO'S should also be aggressively targeted along with gun violence. Law enforcement alone can not solve the city crime problems. We need a holistic approach to improve our city; from better housing, schools, job training and better transportation to help all citizens. We either invest now in education and after school activities and rec centers or pay later with incarceration.</p>",
    "q3":"We have a huge economic disparity problem in this city. Decades have gone by with little to no help in addressing this problem in certain areas in the city. That's why we need all elected officials to work full time for their constituents, we don't need part time politicians. We need a holistic approach to improve our city; from better housing, schools, job training and better transportation to help all citizens. We need to encourage development in other parts of the city. The police need better and constant in-service training. I agree with home tax credit to entice more police to live in the city. I spent 32 yrs in law enforcement and I live in the city. I respect civil protest but when the protest becomes violent or if laws are broken and people get hurt or property destroyed, the police need to step in and enforce the law. For drug issues we need, treatment programs, we need education, prevention training and enforcement of the most violent offenders.</p>",
    "q4":"Yes...we need to do our best to reduce our tax rate. In the city, speculators own block after block in certain areas of the city and their property tax is very minimal. The vacant property sits year after year with speculators doing nothing to improve the block. We need to charge these owners more; we need to increase the land fee more than the building fee for these properties. Speculators are hurting the city with their blighted blocks, vacant homes and vacant land that they own; they need to pay more than homeowners. Completion of our Audit system, audits need to be completed, waste and abuse of city funds must end. From DPW to our school system there is too much waste of tax dollars and only with proper audits will we see how our money is spent. </p><p>TIF's and payments in lieu of taxes etc must be monitored very strictly. In certain blighted areas of the city where development is really needed, yes we should entertain these kinds of benefits. We need to encourage smart development; development that will help other areas of the city. By encouraging proper development, jobs will be created and communities will prosper. Our city tax based grew over 2 billion dollars because of development, but its an \"artificial wealth\". We need to stop tax deals (TIF's etc) from affecting our education fund that we receive from the State, until projects begin paying property tax into the general fund.</p>",
    "q5":"Tax incentives in these areas will help build a better Baltimore. We need to invest in other areas of the city, not just along the water front areas. We need to modify the minor privilege tax program so that people will invest in small businesses in the city. Small businesses are the backbone of the city. Transportation and infrastructure improvement is a must. We need these improvements so that people can walk to work, take a bus to work and be able to shop and buy local. Food deserts in areas are unacceptable. We need to concentrate on blighted areas of the city. Gov Hogan's plan is a start, but we need more assistance from the State. Baltimore city is the economic engine of the State. With the improvement of Baltimore, we will greatly improve our State overall.</p>",
    "q6":"Lack of proper Transportation: folks need to be able to go back and forth to work in a timely fashion. Our current bus routes are outdated; they go no where. We need bus routes to go where people live to where they work in a timely fashion. </p><p>The cost of doing business in Baltimore is expensive with our excessive taxes we put on businesses. We need to do everything we can to encourage job creation. To start a small business, it takes lots of work and capital expense to get up and running. Reducing the business tax burden will hopefully encourage more businesses to open, thus jobs will be created and more supplies, etc will be purchase and what's lost in minor privilege tax will be offset with other taxes generated by the business. Crime/Safety issues: when people and businesses feel safe more money is then spent in the city. More community policing and foot patrol will bring communities and police together. </p><p>Job training for residents: we need a way to generate a good job training base; educate folks in the proper way of resume writing, interview techniques and the proper way to dress and to speak properly to potential employers. In doing the above, residents will feel better about themselves and have hope. Folks have to have hope that things will get better.</p>",
    "q7":"Changes need to be made. To over ride the mayor now by veto we need 3/4 votes by city council. We need to change the vote from 3/4 to 2/3 vote. The City Council needs to be more involved in the Mayors budget plan. I believe that a line item veto for city council should be studied. The Board of Estimate, BOE also needs to be modified. The mayor has too much power at the BOE. Instead of 5 member there should be only 3 members; Mayor, Council President and Comptroller. To do all this either we need to vote in legislation changes or by a voters referendum.</p>",
    "q8":"We need all our city council members to work full time for their constituents and for the city. Committee bills and legislation bills are constantly stuck in committees because our council folks don't show up for work; the bills die in committee. The council salary is a full time salary; we need to demand that our council person work full time.</p><p>We need education reform, more transparency with how North Ave spends money: We need to focus on Economic disparity in areas of the city and improve these areas. Crime issues are always important, we can not arrest ourselves out of this situation, we need treatment for addiction and for metal illness. Youth programs are desperately needed, we need recreation centers which include after school activities. Again, we need to invest in our children now at a young age, we either pay now for better education or pay later with incarceration.</p>",
    "q9":"The 311 system works fine with minor issues, but with major issues the process lacks accountability and proper supervision. If a complaint is forward to the wrong dept, that dept closes the ticket and nother more is done. The caller has to call again for the same complaint. Many times tickets are closed but the problem is still outstanding because there is no supervision to see if the complaint was handled correctly. We spend more money (tax money) in going back and forth with issues instead of handling the complaint the correct way the first time its reported...make it right the first time, saves money. A full time elected officials needs to stay active in the community; constituents services comes first, that is why our council members need to be full time council members.</p>",
    "q10":"I spent 32 yrs as a Public Servant helping people and many years as a community leader and community activist serving my community. As a community leader, I developed the pilot program for community alley gating. This program helps communities regain yard areas and provides a safe play area for families and children. I want to continue to be a public servant but I want to take it to the next level and be a full time public servant, not a part-time politician. All city elected officials should work full time, the salary is a full time salary so we should work for our constituents full time. I was born and raised in the 1st District, knowing the issues in the district like I do is priceless. I worked to develop a city own blighted building in which the city would not do anything but let the building decay. I found a local developer to invest in this building and turn this city own property into an affordable senior living complex. Subsequently, developers saw the success of this project and other near by run down buildings in the area were rehabbed and are now generating income for the city, the buildings are now paying market rate property tax. I was a team member in which the community recently shut down The Big Easy strip club in Fells Point. We worked very hard for over 2 yrs to shut this businesses down. Team work and working together is a huge part of my campaign message.</p>"

    "q1":"The concerns of First District residents are similar to those of people around the City: crime, taxes, and politicians who don't seem to listen or care. </p><p>Crime has spiked in the Southeast and we need to address how criminals are entering our community and why. Commanders in the Southeast have noted that public-private cooperation to monitor the routes used by offenders is key to a long-term crime fighting strategy as well as deploying our diminished police resources to proactively combat criminal behavior.</p><p>Baltimore will be nearly bankrupt within a decade. We must grow the population in order to grow the tax base or else suffer the consequences of our decades of reckless spending. We must reduce both the property tax rate and the personal property tax rates significantly (and 50% for the first two years of home ownership). We should also work to reduce property taxes in a formula commensurate with population growth.</p><p>We need immediate and continuous audits of all City agencies and programs getting over $1M of taxpayer money. From schools to police and everything in between, there is a trust deficit in Baltimore. Until our City can show that its leaders can be effective stewards of citizens' hard-earned money, the books need to be opened and corruption must be rooted out. No new spending should be authorized unless a provision is incorporated that requires comprehensive and continuous audits and oversight of how any money is used.</p>",
    "q2":"I have confidence that the vast majority of Baltimore's Police Officers and members of the Sheriff's Department are doing everything in their power to make our community safe. I have confidence in the Commissioner and want to give him the resources that he and his commanders need to effectively secure the City.</p><p>Baltimore must be a leader in the national dialogue about policing. The failed war on drugs has led to mass incarcerations and distrust between police and the communities they serve. This problem has been decades in the making and cannot be fixed overnight. Smart economics is the ultimate solution to crime: a person with a 9-5 will not be motivated to stay up until 4am selling drugs. The \"demand side\" solutions to crime (treating addiction as a public health concern, making it less-profitable to sell drugs than to get an honest job, and providing housing and business ownership opportunities) are the future. Baltimore should be a leader in this regard.</p><p>A long-term plan notwithstanding, Baltimore is still reeling from its most violent year (per capita) on record. Police must work with the State's Attorney's Office, as well as federal law enforcement, to identify the most violent actors and the ringleaders of Baltimore's most dangerous organizations. </p><p>In the Southeast, officers and commanders have suggested that targeting resources towards cutting off the way criminals enter and move through the First District is smart policing that could immediately do good for residents.</p>",
    "q3":"Baltimore's struggles were laid bare to the nation last year. We must not withdraw from the spotlight, but rather become a national example of turnaround and recovery.</p><p>We all know that the unrest following Freddie Gray's death wasn't a week, or a month, or even a year in the making. Decades of economic decline, unkept promises, mass incarceration, and generations left behind created the powder keg that sat waiting for the match. As much as it pained us to watch national media covering riots in the streets, it was almost more upsetting to see the lack of coverage when people from across the City (far more than the group who created the unrest) came together to clean up.</p><p>The same neighborhoods that were on fire in 1968 burned again in 2016. It is unforgivable that, in fifty years, the economic and social concerns of our City's residents have been ignored in favor of a machine that has left them behind.</p><p>The lesson I draw from the death of Freddie Gray is that we must encourage ownership in Baltimore. The best way to turn our City around is to help people climb the economic ladder and pass on prosperity to their children instead of a sense of longing and despair.</p>",
    "q4":"Property taxes must be lowered in Baltimore. The fact that residents and business owners are paying more-than-double their counterparts anywhere else in the State is an absurdity. Growth in Baltimore is stagnant and, in order to offset a significant financial downturn approaching bankruptcy within the decade, Baltimore needs more residents. The only way to get people to come here in the short term is to make the City more affordable (if we weren't on the verge of insolvency, we would also want to expand services, but any expansion at this point would accelerate the decline). </p><p>An immediate and significant cut, halving the property tax for the first two years of ownership, slashing rates for small businesses and startups, and cutting rates commensurate with growth going forward are the ways we can grow Baltimore and avoid a financial catastrophe.</p><p>Development is essential to bring businesses to Baltimore. However, \"development for development's sake\" isn't what Baltimore needs. A prime example of this is a proposed historic overlay for Fells Point currently being met with resistance by the current City Council. Essentially, the overlay would create a building height restriction in historic Fells. The fact that we need this restriction shows the fear that residents have that development for the sake of development would not preserve the historic quality of our communities. We must undertake to revitalize and encourage businesses while also understanding the uniqueness of Baltimore's neighborhoods.</p>",
    "q5":"When I worked for the Office of the State's Attorney in the Sexual Assault and Domestic Violence Unit, I had the sad occasion to visit the scenes of where some of the most violent and disturbing crimes in our City were taking place: vacant homes. Not only are these sites of drugs, crime, prostitution, human trafficking, and violence, but they are also places where human tragedy goes unseen and unreported. </p><p>I fully support the Governor's effort to reduce blight in our City and I commend the Mayor for her efforts to accelerate removal of vacant houses.This is a bipartisan issue where we all are committed to making the City a better place for all of its residents.</p><p>With regard to revitalization of neighborhoods, we need to make Baltimore more affordable. Large property tax reductions for individual home buyers as well as encouragement for businesses to bring jobs into the City will help to transform communities.</p>",
    "q6":"The chief barrier to economic development in our City is City government. Businesses want to come to Baltimore and people want to live here. However, when they realize the cost of Baltimore and what they get in exchange for such a high rate, they look elsewhere. </p><p>Lowering property taxes, especially for new home buyers, is a critical first step to growing the tax base in the City. As much as we would want to immediately spend more on the myriad of \"quality of life\" issues that our City has, there is a looming budgetary shortfall that will be catastrophic for the City within the decade. It is critical that we get more people in the City and balance our financial outlook before we decide it's time to spend more on programs. </p><p>When the City is taxing small businesses more-than-double anywhere else in the State, is it any wonder that we are losing out on millions of dollars of venture spending despite having some of the best medical and technological infrastructure in the country. Baltimore must emulate other tech-focused cities and make starting a business in Baltimore easier. We need to realize that these businesses are not just \"white coat\" jobs, but also can provide countless, salaried, jobs to Baltimoreans looking for work. Coupled with on-the-job-training and health benefits, these are the kinds of jobs that can help someone buy their first home or eventually start a business of their own.</p>",
    "q7":"How can there be a balance of power without transparency? The balance between the Mayor and Council is less important than the balance between the politicians and the people. It is outrageous that audits are no completed while the City hurtles headlong towards default. Decades of failed policies have led to a situation where City Schools can report operating losses in the tens-of-millions of dollars and yet no bureaucrats are fired.</p><p>People are looking for voices outside of \"business as usual.\" I think people get into politics at the local level for many noble reasons. However, as we've seen consistently played out in both the Mayor's Office and City Council, having a full-slate of single-viewpoints leads to no oversight. </p><p>Even just one voice calling the system to account on behalf of the taxpayers and residents of the City would be an improvement over the status quo.</p>",
    "q8":"The City Council's primary role should be the growth and preservation of Baltimore. The Council must be both the steward of the City's finances and the overseer of the City's expenditures. The Council's role is to maintain transparency in government and make sure that members' constituents' voices are heard at City Hall.</p><p>The most important issue that comes before the Council each year is the City's budget. While the Council does not have full control over budgetary amendment, it is within the Council's purview to question and demand accountability on the spending of taxpayer money. Unfortunately, for decades, the Council has generally failed in this responsibility.</p><p>The Council's numerous votes on allowing for property tax reductions to bring businesses into Baltimore have been important, yet controversial, stepping stones towards growth. The unfortunate consequence of these tax breaks has been, as we are seeing this year, a mis- assessment in the State's education funding formula that calculates total taxable income in local jurisdictions in the allocation of State aid. Baltimore's legislators were right to try to bring businesses to Baltimore, but needed to think of the consequences of those actions. A simple change to the State's education budget formula (likely to be well-received since a stronger business climate in Baltimore is good for the region) could have saved millions.</p>",
    "q9":"We are all painfully aware after the heavy snowfall this winter that the City is often painfully reactive to problems instead of proactive.</p><p>One major example of this is the crumbling urban infrastructure. For decades, we have taken few steps to expand and modernize roads and water/wastewater distribution. Now, we have to deal with exorbitantly high water bills (some so high that residents are being foreclosed on because they cannot afford to pay), water-main bursts, sewage leakages, and crippling traffic. Let's be clear: these problems are the result of decades of inaction and inattention. </p><p>While the delivery of services, water issues, and congestion cannot be fixed overnight, we can take steps to encourage modernization, preventative maintenance, and the coordination with regional partners to allow for innovation and cooperation between jurisdictions for coordination of projects.</p><p>These issues are where residents are better suited than government to pinpoint where services are lacking. Rather than a top-down approach or a one-size-fits-all route to services, we need to listen to what our communities need and work to meet and surpass expectations. Through modernization and the cutting of waste and fraud, we should expect to see an increase in efficiency and responsiveness of City services.</p>",
    "q10":"I am running for office because Baltimore City is verging on insolvency within the decade. Lowering taxes, initiating audits, and providing transparency while opening up bipartisan dialogue are the keys to my message. Our City's economy must improve in order for our communities to thrive. As a property owner and an outsider to Baltimore's political machine, I am ready to bring accountability to our City's leadership.</p>"

    "q1":"Transportation is the most pressing issue in Southeast Baltimore. The population continues to expand, development abounds, while our streets stay the same size. There's no upside to a car-first transportation policy here. An east-west rail route is critical as the main artery of our transit system, and planning for that needs to begin now in anticipation of a more supportive state government. In the meantime, we can use city resources to invest in \"complete streets\" which make walking & biking safe and supported options for our dense historic neighborhoods. While the MTA is historically unresponsive and slow to change, I'm hopeful that we'll see significant improvement in bus reliability and capacity.</p><p>Southeast Baltimore schools have made great strides, but the success is uneven and the buildings can't handle the number of students we have here. I will push to expand funding for Community Schools, pressure North Avenue to be genuinely committed to parental and community engagement in the 21st Century Schools construction process, and advocate for increased ESOL staff serving our immigrant and refugee students. Long-term overcrowding can only be addressed by opening a new elementary-middle school.</p><p>Southeast Baltimore has historically been a place where immigrant communities could settle, buy homes, start businesses, build synagogues and churches, and create community. Our Latin American residents are central to our growth as a diverse, family-oriented community. They need to be well-served by the city and by their councilperson. We need better paths to homeownership and housing stability for these families to prosper.</p>",
    "q2":"The first question is premature. We are only nine months into Commissioner Davis' command. We've experienced the most violent year in our history. And we'll soon have a new mayor with a new approach. The past year hasn't been about implementing new policing strategies, it's been about trying somehow to stem the wave of violence while restoring departmental capacity and working to rebuild community trust.</p><p>We have made progress. Retention and morale have improved, new officers are being trained and entering service, and there is increased confidence by residents and officers in the leadership of Commissioner Davis.</p><p>Violent crime has root causes in addiction, drug trafficking, poverty, unequal opportunity, structural racism, family dysfunction, and our education system. The long-term path toward reduced--not just restrained--violent crime is largely outside the purview of the police.</p><p>For as necessary as it is to emphasize community policing strategies and focus on repeat violent offenders, there is no way to police ourselves out of our violence. Changes in drug policy that would take the profit motivation away from street-level dealing. Increased access to addiction treatment is necessary, as is the improvement of programs focused on young people: job training, education, recreation, youth employment, and mentoring.</p><p>Improved police-community relations begins with officers walking a beat and prioritizing relationship-building. Anti-racism, cultural competency, and deescalation techniques need to be taught at the academy and through in-service training. Financial incentives to attract first responders to become city homeowners will help. And the full roll-out of body cameras is critical.</p>",
    "q3":"Our city has undoubtedly improved over the past twenty years. We are no longer hemorrhaging thousands of people annually. Until 2015, our crime rate had been relatively stable and significantly lower than during the 1990s. Our schools have seen uneven progress but there are more high-quality schools and more flexibility for parents than in the recent past. Many neighborhoods which were at risk of decline have stabilized and begun to improve. While urban blight still dominates in many areas, there are real signs of growth, life, and improvement across many parts of the city.</p><p>The primary lesson I draw from the death of Freddie Gray in police custody, and the subsequent protests and unrest, is that we still have a long way to go. Whatever progress we have made has not improved conditions in many neighborhoods or changed circumstances for many people. When only 10% of our students who start high school will have a bachelors or associates degree ten years later... we have a long way to go. When 37% of black men aged 20-24 are unemployed... we have a long way to go. When 344 people are killed in one year, and more than 900 people are shot... we have a long way to go.</p><p>My hope is that the status quo has been so disrupted by the events of 2015 that our new mayor and City Council will be able to address our long-standing challenges with energy, creativity, and a political will which is currently lacking.</p>",
    "q4":"Yes, Baltimore should lower its property tax rate. The only way to lower our rate in a sustainable and responsible way is to drop it in small increments each year. Our tax base is expanding steadily at this time. This expansion, coupled with more efficient government operations, allows us to be able to afford small annual tax decreases while still maintaining city services. More aggressive proposals floated by fringe policy wonks or attention-seeking candidates are filled with dubious math and reckless economic assumptions. Other proposals seek to \"lower\" the tax rate by creating new fees or increasing existing fees--the idea of charging residents for trash disposal is a prime example. In such situations, we haven't really cut taxes--all we've done is moved our tax policy in a more regressive direction by charging flat fees instead of a progressive property or income tax.</p><p>TIFs and PILOTs have been used too freely over the past decade to subsidize development on some of the most expensive and profitable pieces of property in Baltimore City. There is a broad consensus among city residents that we cannot afford these kinds of policies any longer in light of deep needs elsewhere. I'm heartened to see some of these tax instruments being deployed in transitional neighborhoods away from the waterfront. When we do use these tools, a true community benefit has to result. Leveraging a TIF for a recreation center is nice--but getting guarantees of local hiring, job training, and living wages is more important.</p>",
    "q5":"The Main Streets program is an underutilized tool for encouraging neighborhood-level commercial revitalization. I've worked closely with the Highlandtown Main Streets program and know their effectiveness. I'm supportive of the city's efforts to renew the old manufacturing and warehouse areas along Broening Highway. Jobs in those factories sustained generations of Baltimore families, and increased employment opportunities beyond the normal service sector & retail offerings is important.</p><p>It's often the non-profit sector, in partnership with the government, which is able to make the most progress in terms of residential revitalization. I've worked with Habitat for Humanity, the Southeast Community Development Corporation, and the former Patterson Park Community Development Corporation. They are able to leverage private and public funds to repair homes, increase homeownership, and build community strength in transitional neighborhoods. The Baltimore Regional Neighborhood Initiative, championed by Delegate Hammen, has been successful and deserves further support. Community Land Trusts in other cities have stabilized and restored neighborhoods while prioritizing local leadership and maintaining permanent, affordable, community-controlled housing. CLTs need more policy and financial support from the city and our foundation community.</p><p>Vacants to Value is not perfect but has been the most successful of the three vacancy initiatives of the past fifteen years. We can work to improve it and make it more accessible for individual citizens. Any money that Governor Hogan wants to invest in Baltimore is a good thing--but knocking down buildings while simultaneously taking money out of our city schools and defunding the Red Line is nonsensical.</p>",
    "q6":"The chief barrier to economic development and job creation in Baltimore is an unprepared workforce. When only 10% of our high school students to on to earn any sort of college degree, and there are few real opportunities for job training and apprenticeship, we are left with high percentages of working-age residents who lack the education and skills for the family-supporting jobs that do exist. We need to emphasize vocational education within our high schools, create and expand adult job training centers in the city, work closely with unions and others who have the expertise and experience to run effective apprenticeship programs, and make sure that publicly-funded construction projects are committed to local hiring and job training.</p><p>High rates of addiction also makes a significant percentage of working-age adults functionally unemployable. This is an economic and a public health crisis. Expanded drug treatment and counseling is necessary to help bring people back into the workforce.</p><p>Taxes certainly are a barrier to economic development, and I already discussed my commitment to a slow but steady decrease in our property tax rate.</p>",
    "q7":"Our city has too many strong leaders, and too many challenges, for us to be able to afford to give the mayor as much power as the office currently holds. By rebalancing the systems of power in city government we can create a more collaborative governance model in which the City Council has a more significant role in setting the agenda and developing solutions. It is to a certain extent a waste of the council's time to sit around waiting for the mayor to send an idea their way for approval or rejection--and yet to often that seems to be the dynamic.</p><p>Specifically: 1) the Board of Estimates should have three members (Mayor, Council President, Comptroller). 2) There should be a 2/3rds threshold to override the mayor's veto. 3) The council should be given the authority to add, remove, and adjust line items in the budget.</p>",
    "q8":"There are so many challenges in our city that it is impossible to address all of them at once. Certainly the City Council (within the limits of its present authority) has been engaged in substantive work on police body cameras, recreation center funding, comprehensive rezoning, agency financial & performance audits, funding for youth initiatives, the stormwater fee implementation, and the charter changes regarding rebalancing mayoral and council power.</p><p>At the same time, the council seems to have given little attention to key issues around education, violent crime, police-community relations, housing policy (particularly the crisis in our housing department), and wide-spread efforts at improving employment and economic development.</p>",
    "q9":"The most widespread complaints in recent years have had to do with our water and sewer systems. Long-term maintenance has been put off for so long that there are major and minor crises around the city and throughout the year. Last spring it was possible to walk around Southeast Baltimore and see a water line break every block or two. Meanwhile, our failure to comply with the terms of the consent decree related to improving our sewer system is inexcusable. Every major storm seems to still overwhelm our system and cause us to pump raw sewage directly into our waterways. And of course our water and sewer rates have increased rapidly without a corresponding improvement in service.</p><p>The Department of Transportation is frustrating as well. They routinely fail to plan for the investments necessary to match the pace of development. The streets around Canton Crossing have still not been completed and improved in order to fully accommodate the traffic flow there. The Central Avenue bridge between Harbor East and Harbor Point won't be finished for more than a year after Exelon opens their offices there, routing all traffic onto Caroline Street. When road improvements are made, our lack of a \"one dig\" policy means that very often the same street will be torn up by BGE, repaired, and then torn up again by DOT.</p><p>Improved response time and resident satisfaction can be achieved through regular comprehensive audits, changes in agency leadership, and a greater commitment to communication and neighborhood outreach.</p>",
    "q10":"I am running for City Council because at this critical moment in the history of our city we need public servants who have a love for the people of Baltimore, who are deeply rooted in community, who are dedicated to collaborative leadership, who are optimistic about the future of our city, and who are realistic about the challenges we face. I strive every day to be that kind of leader, to put my own gifts and ideas and energy into the mix alongside community association members, teachers, community organizers, artists, non-profit staff members, business owners, and elected officials. We are all in this together, and I have been engaged in collaborative leadership for more than six years here in Southeast Baltimore--whether it's been an effort to welcome immigrants and refugees or a collaboration to build community across barriers of age and race, whether we're pushing to increase youth employment or remove persistent drug dealers from our corners, whether it's looking for ways to promote homeownership or create a new early childhood education center, whether it's addressing school overcrowding or serving on the master plan team for Patterson Park. In all of those efforts and more I have worked alongside talented and determined neighbors to make real change in our communities.</p><p>That's the kind of leadership we need on the City Council--someone willing to walk alongside other community leaders and be part of the collective long-term efforts necessary to address the major problems facing our district and our city.</p>"

    "q1":"Public Safety/Crime- I will introduce and support legislation directing the Police Department to implement a comprehensive policing strategy that demonstrates resident interaction, walking the beat and taking every reported crime seriously.</p><p>Education Reform- I will work tirelessly to raise the standards of our schools, by directing the Baltimore City Public Schools to implement a comprehensive education strategy that demonstrates increased community schools and parent interaction. I will work to outline a comprehensive plan to change our current schools into community schools and working with community leaders to bring more resources to the schools so that every student has a world-class education.</p><p>Jobs/Economic Development- I will invest in rebuilding our neighborhoods. I will ensure that those who are willing and able to work are provided with employment that pays a living wage. No longer will we spend hundreds of millions of dollars downtown and allow our neighborhoods to look like third world countries. We will fix up every vacant house, we will repair our failing infrastructure, we will fix our broken streets. We will make Baltimore the greatest City in the world to live and work.</p><p>Taxes: I will advocate and support the lowering of our property taxes and the removal of the stormwater tax. As citizens we cannot bear the current tax rate or a tax increase. If we ever want to make our neighborhoods stronger and a great place to live then we have to make sure that they are cost efficient and not heavily taxed. </p>",
    "q2":"While I support the current strategy to reduce violence, I believe that the quality of life crimes that are extremely important to citizens need to have more importance. This is a frustration that citizens throughout the City have expressed to me but more so in the neighborhoods that make up the Northeast Police District. In the Northeast District these non life-threatening calls can go unanswered for hours to no fault of the officers but as a result of the sheer call volume of the district.</p><p>While the current Police leadership has made significant strides to address the systematic issues that plague our City, I think that they have only been partially addressed. I have had the opportunity to work with community groups on neighborhood public safety plans, organizing citizens on patrol walks in their neighborhoods. In order to improve police-community relations there has to be one key element: trust. As City Councilman, I will work to create a comprehensive policing strategy. This strategy will include ending mandatory disparagement agreements for police misconduct cases to improve transparency and public trust.</p><p>We all know that crime is constantly devaluing our neighborhoods while simultaneously sending law-abiding and tax-paying citizens away from our City. We have to get the police department to work with the residents, businesses and faith leaders in the community to set standards for policing in their neighborhoods. As 2nd District Councilman, I will empower our police department to do their jobs in a clear, concise, community focused manner.</p>",
    "q3":"Freddie Gray's death was a tragedy that could have been prevented. In the subsequent protests and unrest we learned the effects of decades of anger and frustration towards a system that many people think has failed them. The social economics of a poor urban America was on display during protests and the unrest. The lack of education, lack of commercial development, and lack of opportunities played a factor in the unrest. The ultimate lesson to be drawn is that our leadership has not been fully engaged in our youth and in order for our City to move forward we must have new leadership that will bring transparency and accountability to our citizens.</p>",
    "q4":"Property taxes must be reduced for the benefit of all Baltimoreans. As a Councilman, I will support a measured and realistic decrease to the property tax over time with there being a substantial decrease in the first year. However, I will not vote for any planned reduction that is too quick or too drastic to be effective or that will cut services from our citizens. Our tax reduction must be responsible and cognizant of the impact that it will have on all our citizens especially those who are less fortunate. While we all of have the duty to keep our City growing, we cannot depend on our homeowners to pay the majority of the taxes in the City. </p><p>While I think that the tax increment financing (TIF) was a good idea to attract large businesses to Baltimore, I think that it is now hurting Baltimore as a whole. When you have large business and developers only concentrating on certain areas of the City such as Harbor Point, other parts of the City are left behind. This is a frustration that citizens throughout the City have expressed to me, more so in the neighborhoods that make up the Northeast Police District</p>",
    "q5":"Baltimore can start investing in those neighborhoods that are away from the waterfront. Encourage commercial and residential revitalization with incentives and the rehabbing of houses. We have to give potential homebuyers and commercial people a reason to want to come to the neighborhoods away from the waterfront.</p><p>The Vacant to Value program gives mixed feelings to Baltimoreans. While it seemed like a good plan initially, I don't think that it has lived up to its full potential. The overall program lacks transparency when it comes to the financing of the program and the actual impact of the program. Since the Vacant to Value program was created there has been a slight increase in vacant properties across Baltimore. Many citizens have expressed frustrations that many houses still sit vacant and that those houses are susceptible to crime and are constantly devaluing the neighborhoods. While many citizens have heard promises of redevelopment they are starting to become less optimistic about the potential outcome.</p><p>Governor Hogan's recent efforts to combat blight are very straightforward. However, I think that the funds allocated to the project could be spent more diversely. Knocking down homes is not the only way to removing blight. We have to bring resources to the people who live in these blight neighborhoods. I would like to see the Governor focus his efforts to combat blight neighborhoods in a way that better serves the public.</p>",
    "q6":"The chief barrier to economic development and job creation in Baltimore is the lack of transparency and accountability. We have to not only mandate but also do random checks to make sure that those companies that have City contracts are hiring the percentage of City residents required by law. As a City Councilman I will invest in rebuilding our neighborhoods. I will work with business associations and business owners to improve the business climate and hire residents in Baltimore. No longer will we spend hundreds of millions of dollars downtown and allow our neighborhoods to look like third world countries. We will fix up every vacant house, we will repair our failing infrastructure, we will fix our broken streets. We will make Baltimore the greatest City in the world to live and work. Just as our constituents depend on the government so does economic development. We have to make sure that those who we serve are kept in mind when we are looking at job creation and economic development.</p>",
    "q7":"Currently our City governance is one in which the Mayor has majority of the power. The current balance of power between the mayor and City Council is not appropriate. This current balance of power not only creates mayor minions (Councilpersons who have sided with the mayor in order to get the first response to adequate City services in their district) but it does not allow for all communities such as those in 2nd District to be heard. As 2nd District Councilman, I will work to create and support legislation to rewrite the City Charter, to give City Council members more power when it comes to their district.</p>",
    "q8":"Overall, I think that the City Council has been focused on the right issues. The most important issues that the City Council has dealt with are homelessness, the City budget, the upgrade of the City technology (i.e. Citi Stat, 311), Minority and Women Enterprise Program and Re-Zoning. While I think that the City Council has focused on the right issues, I think that there are many of those issues that only have been partially addressed. We need to have more resources for youth and the homeless. Everyday the youth and homeless are being underserved by our City government. The future of our youth and the stability of our homeless must be one of the top priorities of everyone in government. Homelessness should never be a never-ending experience. Also, there needs to be a standard living wage for the citizens in Baltimore. All wage earners must be able to adequately support themselves and their families.</p>",
    "q9":"The weakness is a lack of customer service. City services were established to serve not only the City but also the constituents of the City. This is a frustration that citizens throughout Baltimore have expressed to me, more so in the neighborhoods that make up the 2ND District. The lack of customer service has played a big part in the lack of accountability. In order to improve response time and resident satisfaction, City services must be more transparent and accountable. I am a firm believer that transparency and accountability is a necessity in any government structure. As a Councilman I will work tirelessly to introduce a quality assurance strategy for all City services to ensure that residents are being satisfied and serviced in the most efficient and timely way possible.</p>",
    "q10":"I love this City and I want to make Baltimore the best Baltimore that it can be. As a product of Baltimore and proud homeowner in the 2nd District who has the life and professional experiences of a true public servant, I know that I am the one best equipped to be a Councilman. My grandfather always told me \"success starts with falling in love with your work.\" My heart is where my home is and that is in the 2nd District. As a resident of the 2nd District, I have talked to many citizens who are tired of the double talk, political machines and empty promises. Residents want new ideas, new energy and a better now for their community. I have the new ideas and the new energy that will ensure that our communities and district is stronger and focused on the future. As your councilman I will bring transparency and accountability back to the communities and the council seat back to the 2ND District. </p>"

    "q1":"The top three issues in my district are crime, redevelopment and infrastructure needs. Crime in the 2nd District varies from neighborhood to neighborhood. While homicides and shootings are not as common in other areas they do happen thus a focus on the violent repeat offenders causing them. In addition, property crime like burglaries, larceny from autos and stolen autos are the most common of which citizens complain about. We have already started a combined effort to address with police via emails, Citizen on Patrol and data sharing. The plan is to further those partnerships moving to having a daytime NECOP in addition to our well known night time COP. Furthermore, 300menmarch will continue to be out in Belair Edison the most violent part of the district where we have seen a reduction of incidents during our engagements. Before I was elected I vowed to create a plan and begin to redevelop the Belair Road Corridor. We have done that with over $9 million in private investments including the city's first Planet Fitness and a new shopping center alongside Bi-Rite. We have also spent city dollars on a Belair Road TAP Study along with a Market Study that shows the buying power of our area. More development will come as I will continue to lobby and work for it. During my term I have been able to increase street paving projects in a area that had often been forgotten. I will continue to have more projects placed in the city's plan.</p>",
    "q2":"Focusing on violent repeat offenders has proven to be a strategy that works in Baltimore providing two of our least violent years in 2011 and 2014. However, in law enforcement strategies must be constantly updated and tweaked in order to remain effective. I believe that the current leadership at BPD is capable of doing just that but as I always say crime reduction goes well beyond BPD. If we are truly going to address the issue of violence in the long run we must look at violence from the angle of every agency (from Housing to Recreation and Parks) and organization in Baltimore. Moreover, we must begin addressing the issue long before someone becomes the victim or perpetrator of a crime. If Baltimore wants to become even more serious about crime reduction we must invest more dollars in front end programming along with public safety. For example, many statistics show us which young people are most likely to become the victim or perpetrator of a crime as early as 3rd grade. What would crime look like if we invested in Family Strengthening Programs that followed those young people and their families. Of course we must also continue to expand opportunities for young people, create jobs for all and deal with addiction. in my district we currently are holding mediation training with police and teens from the area. In addition, we hold coffee with a cop, late night hoops with a cop and other programs. We will continue these and expand.</p>",
    "q3":"Freddie Gray's death and the unrest that followed did not have to happen for me to understand the issues that have been highlighted in it's wake. I have lived in and with those issues for most of my life growing up poor young and black in Baltimore. However, for me what April provided was proof that some needed throughout our city that we must have significant change to how we operate. Above of all else following April to me its clear that we all must do more if we truly want Baltimore to be more. Everyone, who says they loves Baltimore politicians, business leaders, religious leaders, athletes and all citizens must do more to make our city a better place. In city government that means that we must look at changing everything about the way we operate to the way we elect our leaders. In addition, City Government must clearly be more transparent in order to regain trust with the citizens which is why I am pushing a Open Data Bill that will hopefully pass the council. Moreover, we have to invest in rebuilding relationships and increasing accountability between law enforcement and citizens. I am proud to have been a member of the body camera task force but know that is not enough. Programs like the youth mediation training we are holding in Northeast Baltimore are just one example. Lastly we must figure out a way to harness the energy we saw in April into significant changes in Baltimore.</p>",
    "q4":"Baltimore must figure out a way to continuously lower its property tax rate. This is something that has happened in recent years but must be expanded. However, cutting the property tax rate at a faster past could mean interruption of some of the services that citizens depend on. That is why I believe that one must take a delicate balanced approach when considering to lower the rate. I believe that one solution to that problem is increasing the rate for vacant or blighted properties. Moreover, I believe there must be serious conversation on the impact of Non Profit and other non property tax paying properties on the city. I believe TIFS and PILOTS have their place in the world but must be done in new ways that have a greater impact on the city and neighborhoods in which they are in. I believe that we must begin to include stronger Project Labor Agreements and local hiring in connection to these types of project and will advocate for this especially in my district. In addition, I believe we must begin to figure out ways to have those receiving the assistance to invest immediately in ways that benefit the city well beyond the projects target area especially our most needy areas. Lastly, in connection to TIFs and PILOTs we must fight to have education formulas changed to consider their impact.</p>",
    "q5":"Baltimore can strengthen its efforts to conduct commercial and residential revitalization beyond downtown by being stronger in its efforts to show how great our neighborhoods are. Moreover, I believe it is the duty of the local district elected representatives to be the champion for their areas. In my district the Belair Road Route 1 corridor has long been full of vacant care businesses as it has in every area that it touches across the east coast. The city had no interest in touting this area as a place to redevelop but I demanded that it be done starting with the Belair Road TAP Study and the market study that followed. That market study that shows the strong neighborhoods along the corridor with a huge buying power was used to entice a new $4 million development alongside Bi-Rite and the first city Planet Fitness near by. We were also able to work with a property owner to redevelop another old car lot into community supported businesses In addition, we were able to advocate and receive funding for a upcoming street scape project that will make the area even more desirable for development. Development can happen beyond downtown but it must be fought for consistently. Vacants to Value has had a different impact in different areas in the city. In Northeast Baltimore the programs focus on the few vacant properties has allowed us to be successful in having properties resold. In fact two zipcodes 21214 and 21206 featured in the Baltimore Sun.</p>",
    "q6":"For all the development that has happened and jobs that have been created in the city in recent years there are still many issues that prevent us from taking the next step. One of those issues that I believe goes unspoken is our image. I strongly believe the incorrect perception of our city and certain areas has held those areas back from receiving much needed development. For example imagine if the work done by Come Home Baltimore in Oliver which has transformed the blocks where The Wire was filmed was supported by large scale project developers. How many more jobs would have been created in rebuilding a neighborhood? Moreover, inefficiencies within city government are another huge barrier to job creation. Those who wish to open businesses, build homes or businesses that will create jobs often come to the council in order to seek assistance in dealing with outdated and slow bureaucracy. Baltimore needs to streamline and modernize all of its permit and procurement processes in order to lift a big burden on economic development in the city. In addition, we all know that property taxes and other fees are also a factor in making those interested in development shy away from the city. Our fees and taxes must be evaluated. Lastly, we must figure out a way to have many of our residents who are 2nd chance citizens benefit from the job creation in the city.</p>",
    "q7":"I believe that the entire city charter needs to be look at and updated where needed to regain public trust and mordernize city government. For example, much focus has been on possible changes to the BOE structure. I agree that the structure should change but I think that there is a better change then the proposed reducing the board to just the elected representatives who currently sit on it. Councilmembers are often criticized for decisions made by the BOE of which they have nothing to do with. Yes I understand the Council President chairs the board but he is elected citywide and in a different manner then the council. I believe we should restructure the BOE by removing the DPW Director and placing the Council Vice President in that position. I believe this solution is a better way to balance the power of BOE. In addition,, I believe it is time for Baltimore to join most major cities in having open primary elections. No one should take office after winning a primary with less than majority support but, in Baltimore we often see persons elected after receiving 30 or 40 percent of the vote. This is unacceptable and opening up the primary to a runoff style would prevent this. Lastly, I strongly believe that we must look at the way the council is structured, I believe the council can be more effective and more representative of the entire city while being smaller. I will be introducing legislation to address.</p>",
    "q8":"I believe the Council has been focused on many of the important issues during this term. However, I believe there are some that we have not addressed or spent enough time addressing. Personally I reinstated quarterly oversight hearings of BPD to deal with the crime fight throughout the term which had not happened during the previous term. Moreover, the public safety committee held hearings in reference to in-custody deaths, body cameras, racial profiling and even car stops. In addition, we have tackled speed cameras, local hiring and just passed a new youth program funding bill. However, I believe we must go further in the next term. In order to truly address needs for youth we must first have the data to analyze what is being used and how taxpayer dollars is being spent. Although I introduced it this term we must fully consider moving to a onecard muncipal I.D. system to truly know what our youth want. Moreover, family strengthening programs like The Center For Urban Families can play a huge roll in the future of our city. As a Council we must champion these types of organizations and push for funding to help these programs expand across the city. The next City Council must also continue to focus in on crime but, also must spend more time analyzing data and other basic services provided to citizens. From trash pick up to street paving must be looked it to truly hold the agencies responsible.</p>",
    "q9":"The number one issue with 311 and city services is that there is no way for citizens to follow up and know exactly what was done by which agency on their request. This must change in order for citizens to understand and truly be satisfied with the services. Moreover, once we pass the pending open data legislation it will be important to have agencies share data on types of requests and where they come from in order to help citizens better understand how the services are conducted. In addition, while many citizens in my district constantly thank me for being the reason their street finally received a snow plow after 40 plus years we must improve the tracking of our snow removal efforts. I personally believe the current DOT Director has implemented the best snow removal in my lifetime but, we can be better by using gps and other data that we can share with citizens. In fact the key to improving all city services is using data to not only make them more efficient but, also making them more transparent and open to the citizenry. The council must also focus on this data to improve services in their areas as no one knows a district like the person elected to represent it.</p>",

    "q1":"I will fight for growing a stronger economy, through small businesses and increased employment opportunities. I will fight for increased community resources, quality education, and safer learning environments. I will fight for safer streets for our residents.</p>",
    "q2":"We need more officers on the street, We need more officers to be visible, We need more officers to be compassionate, are the out cries from community members daily. Through police ride – a- longs, and various meetings with the Baltimore City Sheriff's department Police Department, I have seen firsthand what crime can do to a family. I have seen what the Uniformed Officers in Baltimore City go through on a daily basis, as well as what the residents have come to know as everyday life. The disconnection is communication. When community members and Officer begin to communicate, crime will begin to decrease. Communication can only occur if both parties agree to work together. </p><p>I am a firm believer that it takes more than just the police to clean up the neighborhoods, it takes the residents that live in the neighborhoods to stand up for their community. If elected as councilman I will continue to be an advocate for safer communities. I will urge lawmakers to listen to the concerns of safety by the residents, and work with law enforcement to bridge the gap in communication, and build strong relationships with the community leaders, so that the residents can once again feel safe within their communities, and criminals are brought to justice. I will seek funding for implementing cutting-edge technology to more effectively fight crime.</p><p>I will work to deploy advance technology like \"predictive analysis\" forecasts when certain crimes are more likely to occur.</p>",
    "q3":"We need positive police inter action with our youth. We need more resources to keep our youth activily engaged. As the Chairman of the Board at Northwood Baseball League I hosted a cops and kids game following the Freddie Gray tragedy to help rebuild that positive relationship between our officers and our youth. </p>",
    "q4":"I will work with the Mayor to reduce Baltimore's Property Tax. I will work to increase the business and development opportunities along the Harford road corridor and in Northwood shopping center.</p>",
    "q5":"I look to build community driven housing. I will work to reduce vacant housing.</p>",
    "q6":"Economic growth begins and ends with the employment of residents. Across the state of Maryland there are projects and business ventures of varying size in several diverse markets. However, very few of them are actually employing residents. The State offers various training programs, internship and apprenticeship opportunities for the residents. However, the issue arises when a woman graduates from a program that she has invested her time, money, and energy in to learning a skill, and doesn't have the opportunity to interview and/or obtain employment for at least 12 – 18 months. I will fight to pass laws to provide more incentives in place for small business, minority owned business and non-profit business for hiring local residents. In-source is the key to a boost in the economy. Studies show that a young father is more likely to become a consumer if employed locally; a retired veteran is more likely to start her own business if veterans and woman owned standards are up held. I will fight for the minimum wage increase and for equal employment rights between me and women.</p>",
    "q7":"I will look to increase the power of the city council and this will provide a more equitable governing body. Looking at the city charter the distribution of power is one the issues that needs to be addressed.</p>",
    "q8":"More focus needs to be put in to educating our children. As an educator I have found that education facilities are just as important as the curriculum. Students are unable to focus if their environment is inadequate or distracting. The ten year plan has been socialized and schools patiently wait for their respective allotted time to receive aid. In the interim, there is an immediate need for supplemental enrichment programs, high quality instruction, and safer learning environments for the youth. Having met with Advocates for Children and Youth, \"Boys Hope, Girls Hope\", OC #250, and many local school administrators, there is an overcharging need for more community programs for children to receive after school. Currently, Through my organization the D.E.N.T. Group I have partnered with several leaders to address this issue. If elected, I will continue to press lawmakers to ensure that high-quality affordable Child Care subsidy payments are adequate and available for working families as well as less fortunate families; fight for more funding to be available to properly staff after-school programs, provide a light snack for the children, and quality learning facilities, programs, and community centers. </p>",
    "q9":"Transparency and communication between residents and city services. Often time our services agencies are responding to resident concerns however that information is not properly relayed to the resident. An interactive real time response tool similar to the software utilized to provide up to the minute updates for MVA would assist in this effort at the city level.</p>",
    "q10":"I Baltimore native born in the Ednor Gardens-Lakeside neighborhood, embodies the principle – a position doesn't make a person – a person makes a position.

My military career includes work at the Pentagon and National Military Command Center. There I served as a Presidential Top Secret courier and Cyber Information Communications Officer.

    "q1":"The issues of the district are inseparable from the issues of the city as a whole. We are a population of taxpayers whose quality of life is not improving due to generations of disinvestment and racism, whose money is unaccounted for, and whose practical outlook and reasonable expectations of city hall have been overlooked and discounted.</p><p>I will work to dismantle policies that perpetuate institutional racism and replace them with ones that seek to build racial equity. I will start by introducing legislation within my first 100 days in office to increase the minimum wage to at least $15/hr and index it to inflation, support inclusionary zoning and housing requirements and the development of permanently affordable housing, and push our district and our city to build on a vision of transit equity that will help individuals, families, and small business prosper, making main streets like Harford Road, rather than the Inner Harbor, more livable centers of economic growth.</p><p>I will address financial accountability by supporting audits for every city agency, scrutinizing the budget, supporting the appointment of transformative leaders to top positions, and holding city officials accountable through public hearings.</p><p>I will address the concerns of constituents by being a full-time councilman, having an office in the district, and holding regular town-hall meetings.</p><p>Having spent two decades involved in our city's arts culture, I will seek the continued advancement of artists and the arts in setting and furthering an agenda for the city and our neighborhoods.</p>",
    "q2":"As councilman I will consider any nationally established best practice that provides a progressive solution to violent crime. This includes the full legalization of marijuana—and driving down drug demand through innovative public health solutions such as needle exchange programs, expanded mental health services, and expanded transitional housing and drug treatment programs.</p><p>We will see a reduction in violent crime when the income gap between white and black families in Baltimore closes. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the median income for White families in Baltimore is $60,550— the median income for black families is $33,610.</p><p>Put an additional $26,940 into the average black household, and I guarantee there would be an immediate and dramatic reduction in crime.</p><p>The sheer depth of our economic woes has created a crime problem that is beyond the control of the police department.</p><p>I'm the only candidate in the race for 3rd District Council that has pledged to introduce at minimum a $15/hr minimum wage, so that the average worker can at least afford a roof over their heads and the basic necessities for their families.</p>",
    "q3":"I learned that there is a dear price to pay for pursuing racist and economically divisive policies that lead to a lack of affordable housing, poor health outcomes for low income neighborhoods, food deserts, terrible schools, an oppressive police force, disparate transit systems, uncontrollable violent crime, and another uprising.</p><p>I learned that the people in Sandtown-Winchester deserve the same quality of life as my neighbors in Mayfield.</p><p>Our economy has collapsed. Baltimore needs progressive, responsive, and aggressive leadership to address the enormous challenges that were laid bare during the uprising.</p><p>That's why I've pledged to be a fulltime councilman. I've pledged to open an office in the district. I will fight for complete streets projects in my district so that our businesses will see greater foot and cycle traffic. And I will support affordable housing developments, recreational centers, and the arts—so that all of my constituents can enjoy a vibrant, diverse, and economically inclusive community.</p>",
    "q4":"I will support a common sense plan put forth by our next Mayor that cuts property taxes in a responsible and progressive manner. Baltimore has the highest property tax rate in the State. In exchange Baltimore residents enjoy one of the highest murder rates per capita in the United States of America, an economy in shambles, a disconnected transit system, terrible schools, food deserts, and shortened life expectancies. We must invest directly into our communities— it is the only way to tear down the longstanding pillars of institutional racism and systemic inequality.</p><p>I have said repeatedly that I will oppose any PILOTs, TIFs, or other economic development incentives for downtown development projects without similar investments in neighborhoods outside of the inner harbor/downtown business district.</p>",
    "q5":"As an artist I see the value of the vacant housing inventory in Baltimore. I support— Artist Driven Development— a nationally recognized best practice that recruits artists to turn blighted properties into diversified cultural centers. Station North is a perfect example of how creatives can rejuvenate a neighborhood.</p><p>We should also send more of our youths and citizens with a criminal history into the building trades to increase the local construction workforce. Converting our large pool of chronically under and unemployed youth and returning citizens into skilled laborers will dramatically increase the pace, effectiveness, and economic impact of the demolition and rehab efforts taking place throughout Baltimore.</p><p>Imagine City government taking possession of hundreds of thousands of vacant properties, and employing thousands of local residents to do tear down or reconstruction at fair union wages. Imagine that a significant portion of this housing stock came in the form of loans to City residents similar to FHA's 203K program that are backed by contributions from developers in exchange for tax incentives for large commercial development projects.</p>",
    "q6":"Wages:</p><p>We also must do better to develop our workforce into the future. Since I began my campaign, I have supported the city passing a minimum wage of at least $15/hour. This wage would not only assure that workers had enough income to support themselves and their families, but it will promote a higher quality workforce that wants to stay in Baltimore.</p><p>Transportation:</p><p>We have a light rail that only runs north and south; we have a circulator that only services white neighborhoods; we have a metrobus line that is completely unreliable; and we have a subway system that only runs north and south. But the worst part about Baltimore's four flawed mass transit systems, is that our elected officials never bothered to connect all four in AT LEAST ONE LOCATION.</p><p>The Central Maryland Transportation Alliance recently awarded the region a \"D\" grade for its transportation system. And while many municipalities around the nation are investing in transit, Baltimore lags behind with the loss of the Red Line. Our system makes it difficult for people to get to jobs, and stifles the city's ability to attract a quality workforce and new businesses.</p><p>We must address our transportation problems by shortening travel times on all modes of transportation, and that can only happen if we work with the state to ensure that MTA's proposed Baltimore Link becomes a success. We must create an infrastructure for commuting and traveling, like additional bike facilities and better pedestrian access to job centers.</p>",
    "q7":"I do not believe in a \"strong mayor\" style of municipal government. I'm sure the next mayor of Baltimore will disagree with me, but I think that the council should reduce the percentage of votes necessary to override the veto from ¾ to ⅔. </p><p>The relatively increased power for each individual council member means a greater responsibility to scrutinize and take a position on a bill, increasing transparency and responsibility for each council member, holding them more accountable to constituents, and improving morale for citizen engagement with their representatives—something that isn't happening currently.</p><p>Third District Councilman recently voted in support of body cameras along with the rest of his colleagues, before he supported Stephanie Rawlings-Blake's veto of the bill.</p><p>It was one of the few times he showed up to work—as the Sun reported \"Curran has been absent for the highest percentage of committee votes… missing about 60 of 110 votes.\"</p><p>When I win this election, my constituents will know that they have a full time representative with an office in the district, who is engaged in the legislative process. We need an innovative council that seeks policy solutions that will bring an end to our systemic issues with racism and inequality.</p>",
    "q8":"The Baltimore City Council hasn't passed any significant progressive policies other than Ban the Box—which we are still waiting for comprehensive data detailing its impact. Everything else has been tax hikes for residents, and tax giveaways for developers.</p><p>Our council is largely unimaginative, unmotivated, and complacent. City residents—especially in the 3rd District—are ready for change. They are ready for a leader who will tackle the systemic issues plaguing our city with creative, responsible, and prudent public policy. I am that leader.</p>",
    "q9":"Baltimore City Police Officers are sworn to protect and to serve the residents of this City. Unfortunately, the department as a whole is not living up to this mission. The department's morale is low, community trust is virtually non-existent, and the department finds itself short-staffed and over-budget fiscal year after fiscal year.</p><p>I was especially disappointed to see the police department engage in a work slow down in response to the charges against the 6 officers allegedly involved in Freddie Gray's death. I believe that the slowdown had deadly consequences. <P></P>The Police Department is the most essential service provider in all of City Government. As councilman I will work with police commanders to determine how best to recruit more officers to the force—and more importantly to live in the City. Eliminating the vacancies will reduce the overtime expenditures that create annual budget overruns. And having more officers on patrol will decrease response times for non-violent crimes.</p><p>As councilman I will also steer police resources toward cultural sensitivity and mental illness awareness training. Coupled with a fully implemented body camera program, residents will experience significantly more professional and positive interactions with our police. I believe that these positive interactions will restore the community's trust in the BPD, which will in turn lead to greater community cooperation in criminal investigations, which will ultimately reduce crime.</p>",
    "q10":"The 3rd District needs a PROGRESSIVE leader. If elected I will work full time to eliminate the the divisive policies that have created extreme poverty, poor education, high crime, disturbing public health outcomes, and an absence of affordable housing.</p><p>The institutional racism and systemic inequalities that lead to the civil unrest we saw last year must come to an end. I'm running to completely overhaul our racist institutions of power. We cannot afford anything less.</p>"

The 3rd district is located within the NE police district which is by far the largest district in the City encompassing over 120,000 city resident while other districts have as few as 60,000 residents. The district is currently way too large to police effectively. I'm planning to address the issue of vacant homes by creating additional incentives for home owners who are willing to invest in rehabbing vacant such as tax break and connect potential buyers with low interest rehab loans.</p>",
    "q2":"No Baltimore is not pursuing the right strategies to reduce violent crime, to reduce violent crime we need to provide real opportunities for all city residents. Yes I have confidence in the Police Departments current leadership because I feel things are start to get better comparted to where they were previously, but the current leadership does need to place a much stronger more aggressive approach at building relationships with the community. To improve police-community relations I would like to encompass the community in the official training of our officers and establish a citizen review board. I would also like to encourage more officers to live in the city by creating incentive programs such as tax breaks and special loan programs.</p>",
    "q3":"The lessons I drew from the death of Freddie Gray and the subsequent protest and unrest is that many citizens feel their voices aren't being heard and that we need to as a city make sure we begin to provide opportunities for everyone. Many people and communities with in our city have been completely forgotten about and left to defend for themselves.</p>",
    "q4":"Yes Baltimore should reduce its property tax rate, we can accomplish this by ensure \"big business\" and development projects such as Harbor Point pay their fair share. The city currently uses tax incentives to encourage development projects way too often and many time don't get enough back in return. If a developer wants tax incentives for their project then the City should get some guarantees in return such as a commitment to hire local residents.</p>",
    "q5":"To encourage commercial and residential revitalization in neighborhoods away from the waterfront like I stated in question 1 we need to create additional incentives for home owners and business owner who are willing to invest in our communities with things such as tax breaks and offer specialized loans for these individuals so they can obtain the appropriate financing. I feel vacants to value hasn't worked as effectively as many have hoped and there's a lot of questions still yet to be answered about the Governors efforts to have confidence in it such as where's the moneys coming from.</p>",
    "q6":"The chief barriers to economic development and job creation in Baltimore is that the political will to demand accountability from developers isn't there. Our elected officials need to let developers know if they wish to development in our City they must be a responsible neighbor by investing in our communities by do thing such as providing job opportunities to local residents. I would address this issue by making sure developers no longer just take from our city but them also being to invest in our communities financially and with job opportunities.</p>",
    "q7":"I feel the current balance of power between the mayor and city council provides the Mayor with too much power. The best democracy is one with checks and balances and we need to make adjustments to balance out the power of the Mayor. We can accomplish this by removing the City Solicitor and Director of Public Works from the Board of Estimates; in addition to that we can also lower the number of votes needed to override the Mayors veto to something more comparable to other cities.</p>",
    "q8":"No the City Council has not been focusing on the right issues; the issues the council should have focused on were the cities minimum wage, economic workforce development and public safety. The most important issues the council has dealt with in the last four year were body cameras, the budget, and local hiring.</p>",
    "q9":"The weaknesses I see in the delivery of city services is that the quality is not consistent throughout all neighborhoods, for any residents it takes too long to get your issue addressed and their not very reliable. To improve response time and resident satisfaction we need to hold city departments accountable for delivering a quality product.

We also need to do better at making sure departments coordinate between one another to increase efficiency.</p>",

    "q1":"Infrastructure issues within 3rd district schools are a pressing issue. If given the opportunity to be the next Councilwoman in the 3rd district, I will continue to be an advocate for responsible funding for construction. Consistent investment in local school infrastructure will provide and sustain hundreds of local jobs and those jobs create revenue for the City. In addition, although the 3rd district is one of the safest districts in the City, theft is an issue particularly auto theft. Communities can combat this issue by strengthening the relationships between the local police precincts and community associations and inviting officers to neighborhood meetings to discuss crime prevention.</p>",
    "q2":"The Baltimore City Police have a big job to do. I have confidence that the current leadership will learn from the mistakes of the previous administrations and figure out how to effectively protect and serve the people of Baltmore without bias, corruption or misconduct. Effective policing and reduced rates of crime should not come at the expense of civil rights and civil liberties In order to improve police-community relations it is imperative that the Baltimore Police Department, elected officials and community associations work together in a sychronized and strategic fashion to address community issues.</p>",
    "q3":"The death of Freddie Gray, a 25 year-old African American resident of Baltimore, MD, who was arguably unjustly arrested and injured while in police custody and died a week later due to a severed spine, taught us first and foremost that the \"unthinkable\" is capable of happening in Baltimore. It also taught us that:</p><p>1) police misconduct or aggression is not race discrimanatory in the police department; </p><p>2) the residents of Baltimore are tired and ready to take action against the systematic injustices their respective communities face; </p><p>3) police brutality is an unnaceptable practice, regardless of the race of its victims or the race of the officers involved; and </p><p>4) it is essential that steps are taken to ensure that police officers have adequate training and clear protocols for how and when they use aggresive tactics to subdue offenders.</p>",
    "q4":"Yes, Baltimore should reduce its property tax rate; however, with the city's current level of spending the city would not be able to afford tax reductions without having to severly cut budgets in other areas such as city services. Currently, the city's real estate tax rate, is double that of surrounding counties at 2.268 cents per $100 of assessed value. Tax rebating is an essential tool that allows the city to attract businesses; however, these arrangements should be equitable and not the result of a \"comfortable relationship\" between an elected official and developer. When tax breaks are equitable, regular citizens are able to participate in programs such as Vacants to Value.</p>",
    "q5":"I support legislation and practices that are transparent and hold stakeholders accountable. In an effort to keep developers/vendors accountable Community Benefit Agreements (CBAs) should be utilized more. This legally binding agreement allows community groups and city council members the ability to hold developers accountable, while providing certain benefits to the communities being impacted. In addition, the establishment of a management entity to focus on neighborhood improvements; as well as, the expansion of incentives to stabilize and promote redevelopment in neighborhoods away from the waterfront.</p>",
    "q6":"Two chief barriers to economic development are:</p><p>1) insufficent provision and invesment in education; and</p><p>2) ineffective tax structure. Low economic growth results in low incomes. Low incomes are a result of low levels of education and healthcare. Low levels of education and healthcare result in low levels of human capital which results in low productivity. All of these low indicators can be addressed by greater levels of investment. If given the opportunity to be the next Councilwoman in the 3rd district I would advocate for greater investment in workforce training and local business support networks and resources that provide financing and technical assistance for business start-ups and expansions. Also, I would expand youth job programs and advocate for the expansion of green jobs.</p>",
    "q7":"Baltimore's balance of power is healthy. The mayor serves as the city's chief executive and is responsible for proposing a budget, signing legislation into law, appointing departmental directors and overseeing the city's day-to-day operations. The mayor also represents the city on the state, national and international levels. It is the responsibilty of the City Council to adopt a city budget, approve mayoral appointees, levy taxes and make or amend city laws, policies and ordinances.</p>",
    "q8":"In FY15 alone, the City Council focused on some essential priorites that have been in the making for some time now such as:</p><p>Education, - ($38 million for the Mayor's Better Schools Initiative to modernize city school buildings.)</p><p>Public safety - ($5 million for technology upgrades for the Police Department, including field based reporting to reduce paperwork, a timekeeping system to manage overtime use, and advanced crime analysis tools)</p><p>Public services -( $3.9 million for street and highway maintenance)</p><p>Nondiscrimination laws - (private employers are banned from discriminating on the grounds of sexual orientation and gender identity)</p><p>These issues have been some of the core issues within the City Council's focus.</p>",
    "q9":"Lack of customer service, communication and inconsistency are weaknesses surrounding the delivery of city services. In order to strengthen the city's weaknesses is must utilize performance management measures. Performance management is a systemic approach to ensure quality and progress toward organizational goals by aligning structures, processes and routines through a set of reinforcing activities that enable an agency to methodically and routinely monitor the connection between the work underway and the outcomes sought. The amount of complaints should be per department or city service should be notated and frequently analyzed in order to access the proper level of action needed to be taken.</p>",
    "q10":"Service is a lifestyle and I am running for office because I want to revitalize the 3rd district by advocating for better quality schools,stimulating economic development and increasing government transparency.</p>"

I believe that police officers in Baltimore City should be required to live in the city. I believe officers must be held to the same (and higher) standards that citizens are held to. There must be accountability for police who do not respect the lives of those who they are here to protect.</p>",

    "q4":"<p>I believe that it is a crime to create tax incentives for the very rich while under-developing the majority of our city. Harbor Point is a good example of how corrupt this process is. The process is never transparent and never gives heed to community voice. You can follow the money and realize that our elected officials have been railroading TIFs to benefit their major campaign contributors. The latest one was railroaded during a blizzard without community input. We are being bamboozled while bearing the burden of tax support that benefits people who do not even live here.</p>",
    "q5":"<p>The Governor seems to hate Baltimore City. There is no community voice in any of his decisions that regard Baltimore, he does not appear to value us as human beings. Tearing down vacants in west Baltimore may or may not be a viable solution to certain problems, but if the destruction comes with no input from the neighborhood, it can never be done justly, for it will never represent what is good for the people. </p><p>Vacants to Value seems like a great idea, but does not, in reality create much of a real impact. It needs to be reenvisioned and given teeth.</p>",
    "q6":"<p>Our elected officials view economics from a neoliberal lens that believes we need big business to come in and save our city.

    "q1":"The most pressing issues in my district are the following:</p><p>*Investing in children</p><p>As a former School Board member, I place tremendous value on public education. In City Council, I will work to:</p><p>*Ensure that every available resource is invested in our children's education.</p><p>*Promote and expand after-school programs.</p><p>*Invest in recreation, education and skills programs</p><p>*Create safe neighborhoods; I understand the importance of safe neighborhoods for all people. </p><p>*Strengthen neighborhood crime watch programs </p><p>*Provide more educational, social and recreational for our youth to discourage criminal behavior</p><p>*Expand community outreach and crime prevention efforts of the Police Department</p><p>*Empower the community</p><p>*Immediately establish a Community Advisory Board to advise me on important issues in my community </p><p>*Host regular community forums to get input from citizens</p><p>*Be accessible to address community issues</p>",
    "q2":"Our city is not pursuing the right strategies to reduce violent crimes. We are particularly ineffective in our treatment of violent repeat offenders. While the current leaders of the Police Department have made improvements, they have not gone far enough to restore my confidence. There is still a significant and dangerous disconnect between our police and the communities they serve. </p><p>Accordingly, my first recommendation for improving police-community relations (and reducing violent crime) is increasing our application of community policing strategies. Each officer should receive periodic training in using effective community policing methods. The Police Department should develop a sound training curriculum by working with local colleges and universities. After completing a comprehensive course on community policing, each officer should be required to establish working relationships with community leaders and stakeholders. </p><p>I would also reestablish Baltimore's Citizens' Review Board. This body should be empowered to evaluate public complaints against officers, track the related disciplinary actions and make recommendations for policy changes.</p><p>The aforementioned steps should engender mutual trust, better communication, respect and coordination between police officers and the communities they serve. The byproduct will be greater public safety and security.</p>",
    "q3":"The death of Freddie Gray and the subsequent protests served as a dramatic reminder that we have not adequately invested in our youth. When children are not properly nurtured, at home, school and in the community they are susceptible to street life and self destructive behavior.</p><p>To stop the chaos, we must provide better education and social support to our youth in the primary stages of their development. </p><p>I am a big supporter of expanding the use of the community school model. Community schools would serve as the educational and service hub of the entire community. They would be staffed with multidisciplinary teams who could effectively address the myriad of problems are younpg people face. A key component of community schools is the provision of dynamic after school programs focusing on social skill development and academic enrichment. In poor neighborhoods, it is particularly critical that these school based programs include mentoring and peer counseling.</p><p>My main goal is to prevent the significant damage to our children that impedes their growth and development. The words of the great Benjamin Franklin summarize my position: \"An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.\" I am certain that cost of prevention is significantly less than the cost of repair and remediation.</p>",
    "q4":"Baltimore City should reduce its property tax rate. This can be accomplished by increasing the tax rate for big businesses and attracting more families to expand the tax base.</p><p>I am opposed to the use of tax increment financing because this funding approach does not promote the best interest of every day people. The wealth and advantages associated with tax increment financing are completely controlled by big businesses and rarely shared with needy citizens.  This lopsided arrangement can result in increasing the tax burden of the middle class and poor people who can not afford to pay more.</p><p>I strongly support the movement for property tax reform. Our reforms should reduce the tax burden on middle class citizens and ensure that the payments of big businesses are commensurate with their wealth.</p>",
    "q5":"To encourage commercial and residential revitalization in neighborhoods away from the harbor we have to offer significant incentives to developers and private citizens. This would include special financing options, subsidies and reasonable tax breaks.</p><p>I believe that the Vacants to Value Program and Governor Hogan's blight initiative have the potential to produce very positive outcomes. However, we must do a better job of preparing citizens to take advantage of these great opportunities.</p><p>I support city policies that give communities the means to demolish, renovate and sell vacant properties. When this occurs, we must ensure that the new housing opportunities are affordable.</p>",
    "q6":"While Baltimore City has enjoyed economic development and job creation in recent years, many citizens are not ready to take advantage of existing opportunities. Clearly we must educate and train thousands of individuals so they will be ready to compete in the emerging global economy.</p><p>It is well documented that unemployment is a major obstacle for many residents in Baltimore's inner city. This is largely attributable to structural inequality and institutional racism. We must combat this with more effective community based training programs and hiring agreements that ensure job opportunities for newly trained individuals.</p>",
    "q7":"Our system of representative democracy places a premium on checks and balances. The current balance of power between the mayor and City Council is inappropriate because it allows the former to dominate the latter. In our city, the mayor's position is so strong that he/she can circumvent normal accountability standards and ignore the limited oversight powers of the City Council.</p><p>I would support giving the City Council more power in their working relationship with the mayor. This means that we can establish a real system of checks and balances. Additionally, strengthening the City Council position will give the members a greater capacity to protect their constituents and the interest of the city.</p>",
    "q8":"In many instances, the City Council has been on target with its issue focus. The most important issues it has dealt with in the last four years include the following: Requesting a federal investigation of the Baltimore Police Department; Sponsoring Body Camera Legislation; Placing a moratorium on unpaid water fees due to excessive billing; Introducing Affordable Housing Legislation</p>",
    "q9":"A variety of city services can be improved. These include the following critical services: Water provision (including the billing procedures); Social Services; Public Education; Public Safety; Street/Infrastructure repair; Public Housing.</p><P>These critical services can improve through ongoing worker training and better strategic planning. In addition, I would support providing workers with the latest service technology to improve their effectiveness and efficiency. Finally, I support establishing community advisory boards or citizen review committees to provide constructive feedback to city agencies. These steps should result in better service delivery and faster response times.</p>",
    "q10":"I am running for City Council because I love my city and community. I know the people of my community are ready for positive change and forward movement. I want to work with my neighbors to build a dynamic framework for progress. My primary goal is giving every day people a stronger voice in their government. I aim to  increase the capacity of community members to control their own destiny through strategic planning and decisive action.</p><p>My platform for change is based on 4 key principles:</p><p>*Invest in our remarkable children (Promote continued improvement in our public school system)</p><p>*Empower the Community (Promote increased community engagement in determining governmental priorities)</p><p>*Create safer communities (Strengthen the community outreach and crime prevention efforts of the Police Department)</p><p>*Support Community Based Businesses</p><p>In light of my commitment, talent and vast public administration experience, I am certain that I can be an asset to the people of the Third Councilmatic District.</p>"

    "q1":"Walking around my community, I hear three main things repeatedly:</p><p>\"My bills are too high.\" </p><p>\"I'll stay as long as my schools are good.\" </p><p>\"I love Baltimore, but the trash is horrendous.\"</p><p>So what do we do about it?</p><p>Let's start with trash: Litter and run-down neighborhoods are indicative of a mindset. No amount of street-sweepers will change this. We need a changeover, and the way to do that is with the youth. Combining services hours with a sustained approach on youth involvement, will create a generation of young Baltimoreans who have a renewed status-quo for what they call \"home\". I have been deploying this strategy for years. </p><p>Next, schools: Schools that have the better scores, better school environment, and better student satisfaction, are typically schools with high Parent Involvement/Engagement. As the two-year president for the PTO of one of the better performing public schools in the City, I have seen firsthand how parent involvement & engagement can turn a school community around in under a year, even while broader issues of state funding, new(er) buildings, and city-state control are being worked out. Thirdly, lowering utility bills: There are several programs that can lower the costs of energy, water and property taxes within a couple of months. Our residents need to know about these options, and I have a history of informing Baltimoreans about pending changes to their quality of life. </p><p>I would do these things for us as our councilman.</p>",
    "q2":"Though I am running for City Council, I do believe that Baltimore's best police force is one in which all if not most of the officers presently reside in the City during their tenure. </p><p>I believe this holds true from the cadet to the Commissioner. </p><p>A resident cop would view the city as his home and not simply as a place to 'enforce the law against bad guys'. A resident cop would go to the Waverly farmers market on Saturday before taking his kids to an 'event' at the local Enoch Pratt. The resident cop would be able to drive his car home, and be one more positive presence as he cooks on his grill and talks with his neighbors. </p><p>This is how you build community. This is how you begin to improve police/community relations. </p><p>How would I do this? As councilman, I would do two things simultaneously. 1) I would work with the district offices in my part of my town (for me in Govans, those are the Northern and Northeastern depts) to go personally into high schools to recruit graduating seniors into the academy. 2) I would work with programs like Vacants-to-Value as well as private owners to provide housing to officers in my district with significant financial incentive that did not come at a detrimental fiscal cost to my fellow residents. </p><p>This is work that a councilman can do immediately. This is measurable work I can champion, from day 1.</p>",
    "q3":"To quote someone that I respect greatly, Ms. Marin Alsop, Director of the BSO, the Freddie Gray riots of April 2015 may have been one of the few things impactful enough to spark the real social changes that we have needed for quite some time; not only in Baltimore, but veritably for the Nation. </p><p>In certain of those communities, much of that damage existed well before the riots. This had taken place for decades, and no one really stopped the bleeding. </p><p>Additionally, police-community relations had been sour for much longer than the April unrests. Concerted efforts towards these relations are needed. I've laid out my views on improving this in Question 2 of this interview. </p><p>However, there is one more component I'd like to share. After watching countless young people lose their lives in situations not unlike our own Freddie Gray, and sometimes in preventable situations, I personally put out a short How-To video on how to interact with cops. With over 3,000 views and 92 shares (retweets/reposts), the video has been widely well-received across this nation. This has been evidenced by pastors whom have shown it in their churches, parents who have shown it to their children, and teachers who have shown it in their schools. This video, quite literally, could save a life. </p><p>If you care about young people, regardless of race, background or affiliation, view the video and show it to them. The life you save may very well be the life of someone you love.</p>",
    "q4":"Yes, Baltimore's Property Tax rate can be reduced. Taxes are the source of income, the 'paycheck' to the city (so to speak) from its residents. In return for the check, the City is supposed to purchase \"necessities\" (trash collection, zoning, passable roads, safety, etc.), and \"amenities\" (parks, libraries, restaurants, fountains, diversity, etc.).</p><p>That's fine, but to many of us, it seems that we are not getting bang for our buck, and it causes us to have justifiable concerns about our tax rate which is presently higher than MD's average. </p><p>So how do we bring it down?</p><p>Population Growth. </p><p>Many of us are not aware that there is a tax difference between owner-occupied and non-owner-occupied tax rates (Yep). So first of all, that conversion can have an impact on your cost. Secondly, if the budget is set, as we get more owners paying into the pot, the cost per person should go down. </p><p>I will work on this for us, as Councilman.</p>",
    "q5":"I firmly believe that, as the largest city in Maryland, with the densest population in the state, and one of the biggest tourist attractions in the area, \"any major problem for Baltimore is also a major problem for Maryland. As such, we applaud any/all efforts from the state to improve conditions here. </p><p>As we decrease blight in the city and recreate livable homes and institutions, we will continue to attract and retain the citizens of Charm City to stay, work and recreate here.</p><p>The strength of a vibrant city is when the entire city prospers. As a resident of North Baltimore, my own children could benefit from improvements around town. </p><p>This shift in budget policy would most likely occur if my fellow Baltimore leaders, including the new mayor, believed in the economic viability of revitalization around the City.</p><p>I believe this could happen. </p><p>I look forward to working on these initiatives in the future. </p>",
    "q6":"The key to economic growth lies in the ability to attract the creative class, and in translating that underlying advantage into creative economic outcomes in the form of new ideas, new high-tech businesses and regional growth (Florida, 2002).</p><p>Who is the \"Creative Class\"? </p><p>I like to identify them as \"Millenials\"; i.e., the current/recent crop of college graduates who still reside in our city.</p><p>According to C. Hill (2014), regions with large clusters of creative class members are some of the most competitive and affluent regions of the country.</p><p>So what attracts the creative class to a city? Well frankly, Baltimore already does a great job of this. Via the nearly 20 colleges in the Greater Baltimore Metropolitan Area, Baltimore attracts about 200 thousand students each year. The problem is a year or two after graduation, those folks leave. Think about it: 200K creative-class Millenials live, work, learn, play in our city for 4 years, going to our churches, frequenting our cultural centers and making full use of our amenities. And then they cycle out. </p><p>So the real question is how do we retain them? According to Hill (2014), it's the focus on Talent (jobs), Tolerance (diversity), and Technology (innovation). </p><p>Folks, we are primed to do this. Let's recreate locales like The Avenue in Hampden, or the buzz of Federal Hill, or the suburbia of Canton, or the lure of Fells Point; let's do this all across our City.</p>",
    "q7":"According to the SMCI, Baltimore is one of the nation's top cities with a \"strong mayor\" governance format. Specifically, that tends to mean two things definitively: 1) The mayor has an arguable 3/5 sway over the Board of Estimates (which is the body that decides how to spend the city's money). 2) As it relates to council proceedings, it takes more votes to override a mayoral veto than it typically does in some other cities of comparable size. Thirdly (and this is not so definitive) the council has tended to have a 'go-with-the-mayor' stance, instead of beholding unto the residents of the districts that they serve. </p><p>Together, this all means that the mayor has the ability to push a policy with little in the form of checks and balances. </p><p>If our Baltimore were the teeming metropolis today that it was on track to become at the turn of last century, then all of this would probably be a moot point. However, the fact is our Baltimore is what it has become, and if we want a different future trajectory, we may need to have tough conversations about what those changes could look like. </p><p>There are many options: </p>p><P>- electing persons to the Board of Estimates, </p><p>- changing of the veto-override requirements, </p><p>- introducing term limits, </p><p>- etc. </p><p>All of these would help improve the balance of power, and all can be achieved by a collective City Council operating cohesively to get the job done.</p>",
    "q8":"The role of the city council is to review, pass, and remove ordinances (laws) that affect the daily lives of the citizens of Baltimore. Additionally, they are also to review and approve the budget each year proposed by the current mayor. </p><p>Much of their work goes unseen; however, a few hot-button topics have come up over the past few years: bottle-tax, bag-tax, votes on youth & rec centers, and issues affecting the harbor. These are all great issues and directly impact quality of life for residents. </p><p>I also believe that the Council can use its and weight of political force to force issues of state. </p><p>As a member of the State Central Committee, I used the perceived power of my voice to submit testimony in legislative hearings to the Council, to the General Assembly, and to the School Board here at North Ave. Partnering with groups, I used my reach and influence to bring resources needed to families around our city. I weighed in on the Morgan Community Mile, helped launch a youth-activities program, and endeavored to bring $30M of federal aid to the PEN LUCY community of Baltimore via the Choice Neighborhood Program. </p><p>This is the weight of influence that all elected officials could wield should they choose, and it is absolutely the type of elected official I will continue to be, for all of Baltimore. </p><p>All these are reasons why I would like to have the honor of your vote. </p><p>Thank you for strongly considering me!</p>",
    "q9":"There is a saying, \"the squeaky wheel gets the oil\". This of course is an old reference indicating that the portion of a wagon that (makes it known that it) is the most in need, will be the portion of the wagon that will receive the most aid. </p><p>Unfortunately, in our society those who often have the most need also often have the smallest voices. </p><p>Herein lies the job of the elected representative: to be the voice of the voiceless, to advocate for those in need, to champion the causes of the most vulnerable. </p><p>As Councilman, I would advocate that our city integrate cost-effective technology into service delivery, to help streamline our process. Baltimore can join world-class cities that deploy city services via a system of online check & balances. For example, Boston uses a simple system to provide summer jobs for youth. San Francisco sends text reminders to folks who need to show up in court, reapply for assistance, and pay tickets. Durban, South Africa is putting school content online to ease issues of attendance. In this app-driven age, people want to know when/where/what time things will happen. </p><p>For example, had this system been in place for our most recent snow, for example, residents would know how to better gauge their outlook (and also their patience). </p><p>I have led the charge on these things before. As City Councilman, it would be my honor to do it for you, for us, on an even broader scale around Baltimore.</p>",
    "q10":"Baltimore is rich in resource.</p><p>Ask any person who has moved here, has lived here, and who has opted not to leave, and they'll tell you, \"There's just something about Bmore\". It has that \"it factor\", that certain \"je ne sais quoi\". Those of us who love it here, love it because we know there are so many great entities, neighborhoods, resources and services. </p><p>However, something about how we are connecting all of these strengths is just not working properly. </p><p>As a son of the city, I've watched this process from the sidelines for years. </p><p>As a married father, homeowner and resident of the city, I feel like I can assist in bridging some of the gaps that would help bring the Charm back into Charm City. </p><p>I first recognized this in 2009, when I provided food, water, and recycling bins to hundreds of my neighbors, who were facing the seemingly daunting task of losing a weekly trash day. I saw it again in 2014, when I launched \"Play Fit Stay Fit\", an exercise event for mothers and sons in Baltimore, in a response to the social outcry of the lack of youth opportunities in the city. It was also an excellent tool to build bridges between generations in our community. </p><p>I achieved all of this via my own budget, pulling resources together from my own network. </p><p>This is the type of Leadership our city needs.</p><p>I am this type of leader.

    "q1":"(1) Bringing safety and security to the 4th District by shutting down the open-air drug markets on York Road and The Alameda. This is my first order of business and is point one in my ten point plan: https://brianhammock.com/issues/. I will do this by implementing a Quick Uniform Action on Drugs (\"QUAD\") team. QUAD was an effective tool used in Tampa to combat drug markets. The premise is to form a partnership between police and community to identify and engage repeat drug offenders and to disrupt markets. Officers employ tactics to inconvenience drug dealers and buyers rather than emphasizing incarceration. In addition, we will employ nontraditional tactics such as installing CCTV cameras, increasing street lighting, cleaning up trash and cutting high-grass areas, and forming partnerships with area businesses pressured to act as stash houses.</p><p>2. Jobs. We must focus on creating family-supporting wage jobs in Baltimore. We can do this by refocusing our economic development strategy on creating jobs in Baltimore for the people that live in Baltimore. I will lead an effort on the Council to raise the minimum wage to $15 and focus tax incentives to create jobs in manufacturing and around the Port.</p><p>3. Restoring the City Council to a position of relevance as (1) the chief advocate for the neighborhoods they represent, all neighborhoods (not just those with access to elected leaders but those without access), and (2) providing needed oversight to city agencies to ensure our government is working for citizens and not against them.</p>",
    "q2":"No, Baltimore is not pursuing the right strategies to reduce violent crime. My concern with leadership is not at the Police Department but with elected leaders who have failed to implement effective policy on a number of fronts to help the Police Department succeed. It is a fallacy that any one person as police commissioner is going to save our city from all of our ills. We need consistency in police leadership more than anything else.</p><p>To improve police-community relations, I would start by reforming the Civilian Review Board (CRB). As I wrote in a June Op-Ed in The Baltimore Sun, our CRB is non-functional today. We know the DOJ is going to mandate reforms to the CRB when they complete their Civil Rights Investigation. There is no need to wait to make sensible reforms today.</p><p>Secondly, I believe that the best way to improve police-community relations is to bring safety and security to neighborhoods with good, old-fashioned policing. I will advocate that Baltimore implement a program similar to Boston's Same Cops, Same Neighborhoods program so police know the communities they serve and the community know those that are hired to protect them.</p>",
    "q3":"(1) Elected leaders have failed to manage and provide effective oversight of multiple agencies of government to ensure they are working for people and not against them.</p><p>(2) Baltimore has the fourth most expensive police department in the US and we have one of the highest crime rates. We need to reexamine how we spend city dollars because it is apparent this huge investment in \"public safety\" is not effective.</p><p>(3) The people of Baltimore want change and they want elected leaders with a plan to move our city forward again. That is why I am running and why I put out a measurable 10-point plan to move us forward again.</p>",
    "q4":"Yes. Baltimore should reduce property taxes to 1.5 cents per $100 of assessed value on the first $200,000 of assessments. Now is not the time to \"pause\" or \"delay\" a sensible property tax reduction plan. Our property tax rate is more than twice that of surrounding counties. We grow our City by making it more affordable for young and growing families to stay, not less affordable. Now is the time to redouble our efforts to make it easier for families to stay and locate in Baltimore. Lowering the property tax to 1.5 cents on the first $200,000 will incentivize people to stay in Baltimore as they grow. And it is affordable within the framework of our current plan to reduce taxes by 20% by 2020.</p><p>I support the use of TIFs and other tax incentives to encourage growth. The implementation of those policies need reform. We should require greater community impact dollars to flow from the developer to the City to offset losses in education funding. We should also expand our use of TIFs outside of the downtown corridor and focus them in neighborhoods or in job centers around the Port, which will create real jobs that average Baltimoreans can access.</p>",
    "q5":"We need to form a North Baltimore Community Development Corporation to strengthen neighborhoods in the 4th District. The 4th District has seen a 47% increase in vacant properties since 2011. Vacancies hurt our property values and serve as hideouts for criminals. I will work to empower community organizations, in partnership with nonprofits, to take control of problem properties and get them back to productive use.</p><p>Vacants to value is a fine program when attacking entire blocks of blight, but does little for core neighborhoods that are starting to see one or two vacants on a block. It needs reform.</p><p>Governor Hogan's investment in demolition is a great tool for the City. But history shows that the City does not spend the dollars allocated for demolition. Greater oversight is needed by the Council to ensure we spend the investments we have for our City.</p>",
    "q6":"The chief barriers are (1) Baltimore's focus to attract new people to our city rather than create jobs that people already living here can access and (2) a business climate that makes us less competitive than surrounding states.</p><p>To the first point, I will work to refocus tax incentives away from large-scale condo develops downtown instead to development in manufacturing and Port-related industries that offer current residents an opportunity for meaningful employment at a family-supporting wage.</p>",
    "q7":"We need to have an adult conversation as a City about the balance of power between elected leaders. But the public should not have confidence in this discussion when the Council fails to use the power they have today to improve our City. </p><p>For example, when it was announced in February that the City School system faced a budget deficit that eventually totaled $108 million, council members were \"shocked\" to hear the news.  City council members shocked by schools deficit, plan hearings, The Baltimore Sun, 2/18/15. However, the council could have exercised its existing power to receive quarterly budget status reports from the school system and to hold public hearings if there was a projected deficit.</p><p>Another example.  After public housing tenants filed suit against the Housing Authority in September for alleged harassment and sexual abuse, Bill Henry, chair of the council's housing committee said \"I am not sure what authority the council has\" and \"[i]t's unclear to me that anyone locally has any oversight of the agency.\"  See Baltimore Housing Authority eliminated its Inspector General,  The Baltimore Sun, October 31, 2015; and Housing authority employee suspended without pay after joining lawsuit, The Baltimore Sun, November 2, 2015.</p><p>Here again, the council had the power to act, the power to provide needed oversight to protect the citizens of Baltimore, but chose not to act until these issues gain national attention.</p>",
    "q8":"The City Council has not focused on the right issues. See question 7 for further explanation. </p><p>Instead of using the Council's power to call investigative hearings on important issues, and use the power of subpoena if necessary, the Council held investigative and information hearings on municipal composting (15-0202R), valet parking (15-0200R), and air pollution from truck traffic (11-0328R).  Passing resolutions calling for a ban on nontherapeutic use of antibiotics in livestock (14-0194R), a statewide refundable bottle deposit program (13-0139R), and private sponsorships for city fire trucks (12-0043R).  All important issues to be sure.  But shouldn't the council spend a little more time on the issues that lead to so many in our city to rise up and demand change?</p><p>The Council has touched on important issues but only after The Baltimore Sun and other media outlets did the hard work of investigation to expose misconduct and mismanagement.</p>",
    "q9":"The mechanism for deploying city services is broken. Communities are left to fend for themselves. Unless neighborhood leaders call the Mayor or Council President on their cell phones, neighborhood issues are often not addressed. </p><p>We need to fix the broken 311 system and we need to reinvigorate CitiStat. During my campaign I have led volunteer efforts, called District 4 Service Request Quests, to submit 311 service complaints about trash, potholes, and graffiti. Then we tracked the city's response of our website. The first month of doing this we found that over 50% of the requests were closed out as completed by the City but were never completed. By highlighting this issue in a public way, we were able to get better responses from City agencies. That is the work of a good councilperson, and that is the work I will do when I am elected.</p>",
    "q10":"I am running for two main reasons: (1) to end the divide on the York Road corridor that separates communities by those that, at times, receive effective city services and those that feel they have been left behind and forgotten, and (2) because the City Council is broken and has become irrelevant on the issues that impact our city the most. </p><p>It is time that we have professions on the City Council. I know how government works, where it is broken, and have a track record of management in the private sector to restore the Council to a position of prominence. Where the Council serves as the chief advocate for the neighborhoods they represent -- every neighborhood. And where the Council does the hard work of oversight to ensure our City government is working for the people and not against them. </p><p>It is unacceptable that the Baltimore Sun is doing the hard work of investigating city housing scandals, school budget deficits, and police misconduct complaints while the City Council remains passive and refuses to hold investigative hearings or use their power of subpoena to investigate these issues long before they become embarrassing headlines and trauma for our city.</p>"

    "q1":"The most pressing issue for most of my constituents is some permutation of crime, whether it's the broader \"quality of life\" crime that pervades even those areas that aren't challenged with serious or violent crime, or the open air drug markets on the edges of some of my neighborhoods. Solving some of our other big picture issues still won't make a smashed car window, or constant litter in the gutters and on the sidewalks, or an all-night fraternity party going on next door, any less annoying; anecdotally speaking, more people have complained to me about leaving the City because of these nuisances than because their taxes were too high.</p><p>Better enforcement of my Late Night Commercial Operations program has shown positive results, as had the new Social Host citation program that Councilwoman Clarke and I worked on last year. Both have given the police an important tool for reining in problem businesses on commercial corridors and inside neighborhoods, as well as nuisance or party houses.</p><p>With the open-air drug markets, we ​waste millions each year recirculating people ​through the system for possession and other non-violent offenses. LEAD (Law Enforcement Assisted Diversion) - a program I helped bring to Baltimore - allows police officers to divert individuals committing low-level crimes - typically drug-related offenses - away from formal arrest and prosecution and instead into an intensively-managed social services program. Implemented properly, LEAD should reduce other nuisance crimes as those in treatment are no longer committing daily thefts to support their addiction.</p>",
    "q2":"First, we need to improve relations between the police and the communities they're sworn to serve and protect. The police cannot do their jobs without our trust and support, but both of those things need to be earned through transparency, accountability, constant communication, and more direct community engagement. The City Council has passed two of my resolutions asking for changes in state law to address this: one would create a Police Commission - volunteer citizens, nominated by the Mayor, confirmed by the Council after a public hearing - which would hire, fire, and supervise a Chief of Police and set policy for the department, while the other would strengthen the Civilian Review Board.</p><p>Second, while I support the Police Department's leadership and current strategy of targeting violent crime and offenders, I also recognize that it is purely one of law enforcement; a comprehensive long-term solution to reducing violent crime involves major changes to the ways we approach education, recreation, housing, job training, and drug treatment. We should be suspicious of anyone who says we can simply police our way out of our current situation. If we really want to create a sustainable society with less violent crime, we will need to ensure that everyone has access to a decent education, quality affordable housing, and a job that can support them. This will be challenging and will require a great deal of political will – to re-invest in both Baltimore's physical infrastructure, and the human capital that will be Baltimore's future.</p>",
    "q3":"When I reflect back on the uprising, the metaphor that comes to mind is chickens coming home to roost. </p><p>Here in Baltimore City we've spent the better part—or perhaps I should call it the worst part—of the last generation and a half disinvesting in the human capital of our communities. Compared with 25 years ago, the police budget in Baltimore City is almost three times larger than it was. Alternatively, in the 1980s we had 81 recreation centers, where we now have 39 of them. Some say that our population has dropped since then, but it hasn't been cut in half, and certainly the number of City kids who need rec centers hasn't been cut in half. </p><p>There is just no getting around the fact that over that period, our city government has made a conscious and proactive decision to put more resources into police and fewer resources into youth development. We are spending significantly less on recreation than we were a generation ago, even though the City's budget has doubled. Both a well-managed well-trained police department and comprehensive and strategic opportunities for all of our young people are necessary for true and lasting public safety, but investing serious resources only in the police has led to an unbalanced, unsuccessful result - exemplified both in the individual case of Freddie Gray and in the uprising afterwards.</p>",
    "q4":"I think that reducing our property tax rate is an important goal. One immediate way to do so would be to restructure some of our targeted tax credits into blanket rate reductions. For example, the Targeted Homeowners Tax Credit is projected - by 2020 - to provide the equivalent of a 20-cent reduction to owner-occupied properties, while providing no relief to renters or businesses. For the same cost in revenue to the City, we could have simply reduced our property rate by 12 cents for everyone; while it would be a smaller benefit for some residents, it would create a measure of relief for all residents, while also spurring broader reinvestment.</p><p>My thoughts on tax increment financing, payments in lieu of taxes and other incentives are nuanced; I come from a community development background and I have an appreciation of the importance of closing gaps in a development budget. Providing assistance to a project which would not happen without assistance is usually a prudent investment. The amount of assistance provided, however, needs to be carefully scrutinized. While I'm generally supportive of financing the streets and sewers and other capital improvements that should be government's responsibility in the first place, I have made a distinction when it comes to greenspace and recreational sites, believing that those should be looked at in the context of the City's commitment to such infrastructure citywide.</p>",
    "q5":"Baltimore needs a neighborhood-level community development strategy. We live in a City with only two-thirds of the population we had half-a-century ago, but with much of the same infrastructure. There are square blocks of houses all over the City that are mostly vacant and abandoned; the recent foreclosure crisis has now also increased the inventory of vacants scattered throughout the City in otherwise strong neighborhoods. While some of these will eventually be rehabbed through Vacants to Value, Baltimore Housing's own estimates are that about two-thirds will probably never attract the combination of financing, subsidy, and vision needed for successful rehab.</p><p>These houses need to be demolished and Governor Hogan's commitment to the effort is welcome. Where consistent with a community-based master plan, remaining residents on mostly-blighted blocks could even be relocated nearby, so that whole blocks can be cleared. While some of these cleared lots would become strategic development opportunities for housing, retail, office space, or a combination, most of them could be small and medium-sized green spaces: community gardens, small play areas, or just well-maintained grass lots. Thousands of small and medium-sized green spaces would have not only the environmental benefits of increasing the City's storm water management capacity and tree canopy, but would also provide the economic benefit of increasing the value of the remaining nearby houses - which would now be parkfront property! - and by doing so, build our tax base.</p>",
    "q6":"Last year, the Opportunity Collaborative Workforce Development Committee identified several major challenges for workforce development. As a local government, Baltimore City must face the reality that many of our low-skilled adults lack basic reading and basic math skills, many of our low-income workers face transportation barriers while traveling to and from work, and about one in five job seekers in the region report that they have a criminal record that is a barrier to employment. </p><p>We need to provide high schools with the funding to implement basic adult education courses, by allowing them to count young adults enrolled in GED classes as part of their student body. We should look at implementing adult education charter schools, following an approach used in the District of Columbia, where some adult education charter schools provide a combination of basic adult education to prepare for the GED, while concurrently receiving job skills training and support services that increase student success. This would be easier if City government actually controlled City public schools, but that's another conversation.</p><p>I'm already at work on revamping our Inclusionary Housing Program so that it actually provides more affordable housing, to better address the needs of low-income workers, but we clearly need to be doing a lot better. We also need the MTA's plan for BaltimoreLink to provide a truly workable mass transit solution for the hundreds of thousands of Baltimoreans who have no other way to move between home, work, and school.</p>",
    "q7":"We need a more balanced power dynamic between branches of government. Three years ago, I introduced legislation designed to restructure some of the basic practices and institutions of Baltimore City government. The four charter amendments would have to be ratified by the voters at a general election, either if the City Council passes them and the Mayor signs them, or if they are placed on the ballot by petition of the citizenry.</p><p>While the level of turnover that the Council is poised to have this year would seem to reduce the need for the term limits amendment, the other three - and their ability to positively impact the power dynamic between the City Council and the Mayor, while still retaining the main tenants of our \"strong mayor\" system of government - are still very relevant politically.</p><p>While many of us have been on occasion frustrated by the \"strong mayor\" system, from a pure policy perspective, it does provide maximum accountability for the citizens – the Mayor has most of the power, and with most of the power comes most of the responsibility. However, in our current system, the Mayor is so \"strong\" that it makes it hard for the supposed check-and-balance between the executive branch and the legislative branch to function. Giving the Council the ability to truly amend the budget, override vetoes with a more conventional 2/3rds supermajority, and reducing the Council's size would address that dysfunction.</p><p>For more specifics, go to https://www.facebook.com/notes/councilman-bill-henry/thoughts-on-restructuring-baltimore-city-government/1179634005399043</p>",
    "q8":"Some of the biggest issues facing our City - education, public safety, housing - are difficult for us to address directly; technically, the City has no legal control over the schools, the police department, or the housing authority, so we can't pass legislation directly affecting them. Still, we hold hearings into subjects which need to be addressed by other elected officials, promoting open and public dialogue on issues such as civil marriage, liquor regulation, and deaths in police custody.</p><p>However, in this term alone, the City Council has set policy. We created a licensure process - with community input - for businesses that impact residents and want to be open late at night. We've set up a demolition approval process - with community input - for City-owned buildings in neighborhoods, and instituted a citation process for the hosts of unruly social events. We have done a comprehensive revision of our Commission for Historical and Architectural Preservation and its operations, broadened the definition of vacant houses to include a wider group of exterior conditions, and prohibited automated purchasing machines which provided cash for cellphones and other electronics. </p><p>Of course, those are just bills that I sponsored - or cosponsored - during this term. We also set up a licensure process for food trucks, instituted \"ban the box\" practices in the City for most employers, and created a stormwater remediation program - all on top of the hundreds of rezonings and various plan amendments which allow development to proceed in Baltimore City.</p>",
    "q9":"Going door-to-door in Cedarcroft during an earlier run for the Council, I met a young mother. She complained that her real anger was not at the high property taxes she was paying – which she could cut in half by moving a few blocks north – but at the fact that she didn't feel that the services she was getting in return justified the high taxes. I believe people don't mind paying more for something, if they feel they're getting more in return. </p><p>An attitude readjustment is needed throughout Baltimore City government, especially in terms of a more customer service-oriented bureaucracy. Many Baltimoreans wax nostalgic for the Schaefer Administration, for his \"do it now\" attitude. The story of a Mayor calling a staff person and telling them that he had seen an abandoned car on his way to work and wanting it gone by the time he went home resonates with residents who have become accustomed to the City taking days or even weeks to address the simplest tasks.</p><p>As a Council member, this frustrates me even more than it does most of my constituents, since I have the honor and privilege of being a point of collection for such complaints, but neither the power nor authority to order them addressed. My hope and prayer is that the next Mayor will be one who acknowledges that doing the little things right and quickly is just as important as rolling out the sweeping policy initiatives which make headlines.</p>",
    "q10":"I'm from here, I went to school here, and now I'm raising my family here. I want my kids to grow up in a Baltimore that they'll want to stay in also. Throughout my schooling, my career, and my civic engagement, my goal has always been to figure out how Baltimore could be better and then make it happen; I've spent most of my adult life working with individuals and organizations similarly committed to that goal. Whether that effort was focused on the neighborhoods of Greater Homewood, the York-Greenmount Corridor, Patterson Park, or the City as a whole, all of the various takeaways from those endeavors - and my work on the Council to date - have contributed to making me the best candidate to keep representing the 4th District in Baltimore City Council.</p>"

    "q1":"We are \"One Baltimore\" and as such the issues of our City are those of our District. Education, jobs, safe & clean neighborhoods and opportunities for youth and young adults are in the forefront of what is on the minds of our neighbors. As a City Councilman I would make certain that the tough questions were posed and answers given by school board executives guaranteeing transparency and accountability. Without adequate education or vocational training our citizens will not be prepared to enter the workforce. For the last 28 years one of my main duties was to promote commerce between Italy and our City and State. Some of these projects have included Tenax Corporation and its affiliate Syntec, LLC, Maccaferri, USA, Fila Footwear, Inc. and Fila USA Inc., and HMS Host to name a few. All who have added hundreds and thousands of Maryland jobs? Most recently I worked with U.S. Wind, an off shore wind Energy Company that will bring 6,000 jobs to Baltimore and the region. As Councilman I will do what is necessary to make sure that Baltimoreans get an opportunity to fill those positions. As Councilman I will work to repair the relationship between community and police making sure that all citizens have an opportunity to know the officers that serve and protect them. Furthermore, I will fight for after school programs at our schools and recreation centers and work to replace vacant, dirty properties with efficient, affordable housing so all workers can own their own home.</p>",
    "q2":"As a City we must move from a policy of high arrest that burdens communities to a strategy which targets the most dangerous of offenders. We need to rebuild community trust of those who serve and protect us from danger. We must end a policy of criminalizing rather than treating addiction. We must give support to at risk juveniles and offer assistance to ex-offenders when they leave prison. I do believe the current leadership, with the support of the Mayor and City Council, can make this a reality. To improve police-community relations we must begin with a viable Civilian Review Board, mandate body cameras for all police officers, recruit police officers who live in the City they serve and protect, better investigate allegations of police misconduct and reform the Law Enforcement Officers' Bill of Rights.</p>",
    "q3":"The events that followed the tragic death of Freddie Gray while in the custody of the Baltimore Police Department brought to light more than just an issue of strained relations between the Police Department and the community. It brought to a head an ongoing and growing issue of socioeconomic disparity that has made crime the largest employer in our poorest of neighborhoods. It has reminded us that we must better educate and train our youth and young adults to prepare them for the workforce, create jobs and affordable housing opportunities, counsel and treat drug addiction and provide an alternative to crime for our most vulnerable citizens</p>",
    "q4":"I firmly believe that we must lower the property tax rate for owner occupied homes to $1.80 (from $2.10) per $100 for the first $ 300,000 in assessed value without the creation of a municipal solid waste management fee or any modification to the Homestead Tax Credit Program which limits how much a property's taxable assessment can increase from year to year. While incentives like TIF's are necessary to encourage development, they cannot affect our school funding. Therefore, until the MD General Assembly Bill that proposes state funding formulas stop considering the increased property value from tax-increment-financing deals is passed into law or a substantial benefit for the local community is not included we should put a hold on TIF's.</p>",
    "q5":"We must first decide which vacants should be renovated and which should be demolished. Those that make sense to renovate should be candidates for the Vacants to Value Program and the remainder should be demolished and replaced with safe, energy efficient affordable housing for the residents of our city build by Baltimoreans. The Vacants to Value Program has shown to be successful in the right properties. The Governor's program needs to be substantially reinforced to be effective. In its present state it is palliative at best.</p>",
    "q6":"Major barriers include: a young work force without the necessary education or vocational training to work in a modern employment setting and an inefficient Public Transportation System that is not able to get workers to jobs without hours of commuting. As a Councilman I would fight to eliminate high school dropouts and encourage greater vocational training to prepare our youth for good paying jobs in the community. I would encourage apprenticeship and summer internship programs. I would further work with our delegation in Annapolis to attain common sense solutions for comprehensive rail and bus lines to serve our citizens</p>",
    "q7":"I do believe the current balance of power between the Mayor and City Council is appropriate. The Mayor needs to be the executive and the City Council the legislative.</p>",
    "q8":"To paraphrase Benjamin Franklin: \"Who fails to plan ultimately plans to fail\". The City Council has applied many bandages but has not created a plan to cure the City's ills. As a Councilman I would bring the Council together to create a road to opportunity, financial independence and better living. We must start with educating and training our youth and young adults to be prepared to enter the work force. Provide quality after school mentoring programs with sports, music and the arts. We must bring employers together with workers to create apprenticeships and internships. Create programs where ex-offenders can get good paying jobs. Eliminate food deserts. Build affordable efficient modern housing for our workers in their own clean safe neighborhoods where crime is not an employer. Where drug addiction is treated and not criminalized. Create a transportation infrastructure to get our citizens efficiently to work and back. We must not allow special interest to govern our actions. WE MUST PUT BALTIMORE FIRST!</p>",
    "q9":"Baltimore's 311 System was at one time a national model. Today it is unable to process citizen complaints and concerns adequately. Multiple calls must be made before the right city agency is informed of any given issue. As a councilman I will fight to make 311 a national model again by demanding specific response time to all calls and a follow-up to all services.Notwithstanding the 2012 vote to mandate audits of the 13 key city agencies, only three have been done. As a Councilman I would demand hearings to compel the required audits to be made. I would further sponsor legislation to mandate annual audits to all city agencies on an annual basis to guarantee maximum transparency and efficiency.</p>",
    "q10":"To make a difference and improve the quality of life for the residents of the 4th District and City of Baltimore! I am running to combat the complacency of our current political establishment. I am running to keep special interest out of the City Council. I am running to give our community greater opportunities through education, after school programs for our youth, Job training & counseling, job creation and affordable housing in safe neighborhoods.</p>"

As City Councilman for the 5th district, I have begun to and will continue to bring the type of low tech, labor intensive industry BACK to Baltimore to accommodate the education level of our current population as well as attracting the future hi tech industry that today's youth are being trained for.

    "bio":"<p>Gardner, a neighborhood liaison for City Council President Bernard C. “Jack” Young, has not previously held elected office.</p>",
    "q1":"Here are three pressing issues in the 5th District:</p><p>Economic Development – We need investments to spur economic development, which will help to create opportunities for all. These investments need to not only come from developers, but also from the City. Fiscal investments will help to entice developers to propose Planned Unit Developments, which will bring housing opportunities, jobs, and retail in one central location. Also, we need physical investments in the form of skills training and job placement so people can be a part of the opportunity to pursue the American Dream. </p><p>Public Safety – We need actions and solutions to address the fraction between the Baltimore Police Department and the citizens they serve. I will work with the Mayor and BPD to address crime and concerns, improving police-to-community relations via community events, and reinvigorating community pride all throughout Northwest Baltimore.</p><p>Pimlico Race Track - Pimlico is in dire need of help and we need a councilperson that will work with our state partners to advocate for incentives and solutions to not only keep the Preakness Stakes at Pimlico, but serve as the catalyst for more investments to make Pimlico a world-class race track and gaming facility.</p><p>When elected, I will serve on the Taxation, Finance, and Economic Development Committee and the Public Safety so I can help create, vet, and pass bills and resolutions that will bring real results to our district.</p>",
    "q2":"I think the Police Department's recent push to return to community-policing strategies is a solid first step in reducing the violent crime rate and mending the fractured relationship between the BPD and the public they serve. The BPD will be reinvigorating the \"Officer Friendly\" program and expanding the curriculum to more schools. Having more officers on foot patrol is bringing a stronger, more visible police presence in our communities. As people become more familiar with their police officers, residents will feel comfortable in sharing important information regarding crime. This will lead to getting more bad citizens off of our streets. </p><p>Although the year is young, when compared to last year, overall crime is down. I think the BPD should be commended for their tireless and thankless work to help protect the community. I want to see the BPD do more to serve the community. I will worth with the Mayor and the Police Commissioner to get more involved in community events that give back to the community. </p><p>Commissioner Kevin Davis is extremely personable, outgoing, and involved in the community. Citizens continue to make positive statements about the changes he is making within the Police Department. More importantly, Commissioner Davis has the respect of the BPD officers. I believe that the next Mayor should keep Commissioner Davis until he loses the respect of the BPD officers and the respect of the citizens he is sworn to protect and serve.</p>",
    "q3":"It is quite clear that the history of unequal investment in our communities spurred a demonstration of frustration and unhappiness. We need to invest more in our youth by creating state-of-the-art recreational facilities, expanding the Baltimore City Youth Snow program to hire more youth, expand YouthWorks to hire more youth, and promote opportunities for youth to give back and make a positive contribution to their communities. These actions can help to change communities and can serve as a catalyst for developers to want to invest more in our communities. </p>",
    "q4":"The property tax rate definitely needs to be reduced so we can do more to attract and retain the citizens of Baltimore. The property tax rate, which is currently at $2.248 per every $100 assessed value, is outrageously higher than the property tax rates of surrounding counties. However, property taxes are necessary to fund city services and operations. More families moving to Baltimore and paying property taxes will offset the financial loss from lowering the property tax rate. Since the housing market is still a \"buyer's market\", we need to continue to aggressively market the benefits to living in such a diverse and beautiful city. Live Baltimore launched a campaign to attract DC workers to move to Baltimore, and we need to expand that campaign to surrounding areas, like Wilmington, Philadelphia, and Northern Virginia, all of which are accessible via public transportation.</p><p>Although PILOTs and TIFs are an expensive use of tax payer dollars, where millions of dollars' worth of tax breaks go to developers, they are necessary to spur investment in neighborhoods outside of the waterfront. We need to make it a requirement that all public-financing options must come with an agreement from the developer that developers must fund a community-enhancement fund. This fund will be used to provide money to local nonprofits, community associations, and groups that continue make a positive impact. Also, this fund should have community representation that will help to decide who gets funds and how much funds they get. </p>",
    "q5":"Again, we need to offer incentives that will entice developers to invest in neighborhoods away from the waterfront. Public-financing options like PILOTs and TIFs are expensive, but their results are undeniable. Mondawmin Mall and Belvedere Square are two great examples of how TIFs can dramatically change around a neighborhood. </p><p>The Vacants to Value program has not worked in all neighborhoods. Communities with nuisance violations and few vacant properties will tell you success stories of how the streamlined enforcement helped to preserve the community, but you still have blocks of vacant houses in less-desirable communities that no one wants to buy because of underinvestment. We need to demolish more of these vacant blocks and use resources to build new residential establishments, commercial establishments, open space areas, recreation centers, or community gardens. All of those options will help to change the blight in our community.</p>",
    "q6":"Baltimoreans are unemployed and the lack of job opportunities make it difficult to get employed. Also, the current transportation system makes it difficult for resident without cars to get to work on time and keep their job. </p><p>We need to make it easier for people to create new business, which will create more jobs. By working with developers and creating tax credits to help out small businesses, we will provide substantive jobs for residents and bringing much needed development projects to the district. If the Circulator's route was extended to the 5th District, residents would then have access to job opportunities in the downtown area, and other residents would have the opportunity to visit some of the great businesses and attractions we have in the 5th District.</p>",
    "q7":"Our city government operates in what is known as a \"strong-mayoral system\" because the mayor holds so much power. Proposing any legislation that will weaken our strong-mayoral system will require the passage of a special charter amendment calling for such action to be taken. The last such piece of legislation that was proposed was Councilman Henry's Mayor and City Council Resolution to change the makeup of the Board of Estimates. I would support the passage of any charter amendment if my constituents support it. Even after the City Council passes and the Mayor signs the bill, the amendment will ultimately go to the voters of the city for adoption or rejection.</p>",
    "q8":"The City Council has been working diligently to address issues that are plaguing the city. The most important issues they have dealt with is providing job opportunities to city residents, addressing the disconnect between police officers and residents, and government transparency.</p><p>Council President Young introduced and passed the Local Hiring Act that set standards for contractors doing business with the city to hire more local residents. Councilman Scott passed the health inspection bill that requires the posting of failed health inspections so residents can be aware of health inspections of restaurants they eat at. Finally, the City Council has held investigative hearings to find out what BPD is doing and offer good suggestions to improving their actions. This ultimately led to getting body cameras on officers, the shift to community policing, and more officers engaging the community they serve.</p>",
    "q9":"The biggest weakness in delivering city services is the follow up to the residents. When someone calls 311 and the service request gets transferred to the correct agency, residents rarely get the follow up from that point on. I think an automatic update via phone call or text message should be delivered to the resident to let them know that the service request was fulfilled, and if it was not, provide a number for the resident to call.</p>",
    "q10":"I am running for the District 5 council seat because our district needs proven leadership that will deliver results to all neighborhoods. Like other districts, the 5th District possesses some affluent, well-to-do communities, and some struggling, not-so-well-off communities. I will fight to raise the quota for quality of living and works to help all residents and communities to achieve that quota. Our district can and will come closer to reaching its potential when we make key investments in economic development, transportation and infrastructure, public safety, improving education, and reinvigorating the Pimlico Race Track. </p><p>Since Councilwoman Spector is retiring, I am the only candidate in the 5th District that is equipped to be a councilperson on \"Day One\". I know the legislative process, worked to resolve community concerns and problems, handled countless service requests, and maintain strong relationships with other elected officials. If elected, I will continue to listen and address community concerns via service requests and introducing legislation that will positively impact my district. Also, I will continue to be a visible force in the district, working to help residents and businesses reach their potential.</p>"

    "q1":"Crime/Public Safety; Environment; Jobs; Group Homes; Education</p>",
    "q2":"I was present w/ Commissioner Davis when he was swarn in & conversed with him about several issues that would help improve the Baltimore Police Department and its relationship with communities. Initially, I was a little hesitant but after our meeting and the opportunity to see him reach out to other community leaders, I was willing to give him a chance. In order to build police-community relations the officers must develop a relationship w/ elementary school students & reimplement Officer Friendly program. In addition, we must bring officers back to live in communities, patrol our streets and alleys, and walk the beat in all communities. The recent tax reductions for officers purchasing houses is a good start. We must restructure the entire academy training program to include interactiong w/ community members. We must restructure the officers bill of rights & make sure it the includes language that will protect the citizens of Baltimore. We must give some power to the 9 community relations councils & allow them to do an annual report card on the major for each district. We must restructure the Civilian Review Board to include a member from each of the community relations councils & a few other citizens and give them the power to reprimand bad officers. in addition, the CRB should also do an annual report card on the commissioner. We must completely rid the department of police brutality and reform the criminal justice system and include the policing agencies.</p>",
    "q3":"The most important lesson that I drew was we need to stop investing all our tax payers dollars in the inner harbor and invest in communities again and give our young men and woman another alternative besides things that don't bring about positive changes in our communities. We must not allow police to determine when someone needs medical attention. We place alot of trust in police officers in areas where they have limitied expertise. I am suggesting that when someone asks for medical attention that a paramedic be called to make that assessment and not leave it in the hands of police officers to make a judgement call. The unrest was a national outcry that we have to retrain police officers and hold them accountable when they feel that lives of young black males don't matter. As a participant myself, my concern was that we not tear up our own communities but we protest in a peaceful manner to achieve the changes the city needs. It was an outcry that we need to listen to our young people and not tell them what we are gonna do for them but allow them to have a voice in the process to make changes. We must restructure our school system so that our kids can receive a world class education. We must retrain members of communiites to be skilled laborers that can participate in rebuilding their own community and at the same time make living wage of at least $15 per hour.</p>",
    "q4":"Several years ago, I sat on the Mayor's Blue Ribbon Tax Panel that looked at lowering the tax rate for Baltimore City from $2.28 per hundred but due to the city's decreasing population not much could be done other than a $.02 reduction. In order for our city to substantially decrease the property tax rate we must make a real attempt to decrease the number of vacant houses. One way to tackle this issue is to allow current residents that currently rent in the city and have a job to enter into a year lease for $100 per month. At the end of the year, the resident must have renovated the home and all work must meet city building codes. The money that the state has set aside for improving homes can create a fund for residents to acquire grants and or no collateral loans. At the end of the year if the house does not meet the specifications of the agreement, the city will not turn over the deed to residents but those that do will receive the deed and will recieve a valuable investment and the city will substantially increase its tax base. Contractors must use residents and should receive a tax incentive. I am not a supporter of the city's use of TIFs because they have not produced longterm employment and the tax boost necessary to help decrease our tax rate. Many of the properties that are built are apartments and don't increase our tax base.</p>",
    "q5":"Baltimore must reinvest in the people that have been a part of the fabric of the city for so long and stop extensive taxing and feeing residents. We must provide resources in the form of one time grants and loans to small and minority businesses in the city and offer residents an opportunity to become home owners in Baltimore. I am not a proponent of the Vacants to Values Program because it is alot of red tape and make it difficult for persons who want to invest but can't get a grant or loan to fix up the houses. I have not seen if the Governor's plan will provide grants and in some cases loans to assist residents taking ownership of the vacant houses in the area. As for economic development, the money that the state is providing should be leverage against federal funds so we can they can have a long term impact. We need a program similar to empowerment zones that will provide long term funding for businesses and residential revitalization. Most businesses fail within the first 5 years due to lack of access to long term funding. As a forner business owner for over 17 years, I support grants for startups and a long term fund set up that is not riddled in red tape. Often when funds are set aside, there is so much red tape that most people get discouraged and give up on the process. The grants could be backed by human capital.</p>",
    "q6":"The chief barriers to economic development are lack of funding and investment in the problem areas. I would create opportunities for businesses in communities to be leverage w/ human capitial. In addition, the agency that is responsible for the funding must undergo annual audits and agree to keep operating costs at a minimum so more funds can be used to maximize funds for business creation. The small businesses must be enrolled in the 8(a) program or other programs with the Small Business Administration.</p>",
    "q7":"No, currently the mayor has all the power and I believe the balance of power should be equal and require the mayor to seek the individual approval of each council member in order to pass legislation. I am hoping in the future the council won't be made up persons that rubber stamp all the mayor's legislation for personal gains and really work to improve the living conditions of city residents.</p>",
    "q8":"No, I would say not. I don't feel that they have focused on the needs of the residents outside of communities surrounding the Inner Harbor. The most important issues of the past four years has been the closing of recreation centers, Harbor Point, body cameras, and Officers Bill of Rights.</p>",
    "q9":"Residents of this city pay the highest taxes in the state and receive the worse service. We need to make sure that we implement improved customer service standards with performance matrixes on each city agencies. We must hold these agencies accountable and take action when performance measures are subpar. All services should provide a survey after each service call.</p>",
    "q10":"I am running for office because as a community leader for all most a decade, I had an opportunity to join and advocate for communities across this district on issues that are pertinent to the residents of the 5th district. I also fought current elected officials on various issues and encouraged them to introduce legislation that will improve the lives for all city residents. In addition, I worked w/ the city agencies to improve our parks and green space, to attempt to bring a parking lot for the local library, and to keep our communiites clean and safe. Recently, I spent several days in court w/ community members fighting against an unlicensed group home.</p>"

The PSA open space is a centrally-located potential community building safe haven, where Baltimore Police and Fire employees can watch, play with, and coach youth in sports games. The JFT extension will transform District 5 by connecting it to Druid Hill Park to downtown via a recreation, exercise, and commuting trail. </p>",
    "q2":"Violence and bloodshed in Baltimore is out of control, and the city must do more to stop it. The \"war room\" strategy of local and federal collaboration to centralize intelligence and maximize resources to combat violent crime is a common sense strategy that must be continued and enhanced. To compliment that work and get more guns off the street, the city should immediately re-start GunStat. In addition, the City should highlight and laud good police work to boost police morale because, in order to safeguard the public, the City needs the police to do their jobs.</p><p>I am confident Commissioner Davis is leading the Police Department in the right direction. Commissioner Davis's work, including targeting repeat violent offenders, getting guns off the street, and community policing efforts, is promising. </p><p>As a member of the City Council, I will strongly support all community policing efforts and stand up in appreciation of positive police work. I will encourage the hiring of homegrown police officers who live in Baltimore City and advocate for incentivizing police officers to live in the communities where they work. I will encourage the assignment of beat cops to our city neighborhoods to patrol the streets on foot and engage the citizens of Baltimore. I will advocate for police officers on the street to wear body cameras. In addition, I will advocate for investment in crime prevention like the teaching of conflict resolution in schools and enhancing youth education in the juvenile justice system. </p>",
    "q3":"Baltimore needs to come together as a city-wide community, address the racial and economic divisions in our city, and expand opportunities to succeed for all citizens. To move forward from the unrest, the city needs leaders who will cross over those divides and work to elevate the quality of life in every neighborhood in our city. The city must nurture the authentic Baltimore neighborhoods and celebrate their diversity, rejuvenate vacant areas, and encourage our local businesses and good neighbors to remain the backbone of our city. The city must also identify and eliminate the root causes of the unrest that are plaguing our communities-for example, a lack of economic opportunity, unlivable lead-infested housing stock, food deserts, a history of distrust between communities and the police who have sworn to serve and protect them, and the collateral consequences of mass arrests and incarceration.</p>",
    "q4":"Yes. The city should reduce its property tax rate to encourage more people to stay in, invest in, and move to the city, so that the city's tax base increases. The fact that the city's tax rate is two times that of the counties is an incredible disincentive to both the retention of our citizens, investment in our challenged neighborhoods, and the growth of our city. The city must make a firm commitment to the significant reduction of its property taxes over a set time so that people believe it will happen and bet on it happening by staying in, investing in, or moving to the city. The city needs to consider smart alternative revenue sources that do not simply swap one tax for another. I am against a regressive trash/solid waste management fee. I am in favor of taxing vacant properties at a higher rate than occupied properties. In addition, a common sense way to throw rocks at the Goliath property tax rate is to target and eliminate government inefficiencies. Tax increment financing, payments in lieu of taxes, and other incentives to encourage development are generally a good idea to spur progress in the city, but they should be carefully scrutinized for their impacts on the entire city, and the city should require the beneficiary of a tax incentive to invest in the future of the city by, for example, building a recreation center.</p>",
    "q5":"The city should advocate for and stimulate investment in neighborhoods other than the waterfront through incentives for revitalization projects. For example, there are too many city neighborhoods in need of a supermarket, and the city should grant tax breaks for supermarkets to operate in those food deserts. The city must also find ways to improve city-wide transportation options, including expanding Circulator routes, to connect the people of all neighborhoods to opportunities throughout the city. In addition, a higher tax on vacant properties would encourage the selling of such properties for a better, more productive use. </p><p>Vacants to Value is a good idea in theory, but the program has not achieved big results in practice. Governor Hogan's Project CORE is a promising initiative given the State's large investment in the demolition of vacant city properties, and the potential opportunities for new green space and for local workers, of all skill levels, to work on the demolition projects.</p>",
    "q6":"The chief barriers are crime; lack of education and job skills among many city residents; an inadequate transportation system; the collateral consequences of mass arrests and incarceration; city government inefficiencies; and unnecessary and unfair business fees. I would prioritize public safety, job skills training at public schools, and job training programs for all workers. I would also advocate for a city-wide transportation network and knocking down barriers for citizens to re-enter society. In addition, I would streamline the City permitting process (both the number of necessary permits and the process through which they are obtained), so that it does not take a multitude of permits to complete one project like building a neighborhood restaurant. Finally, I would eliminate minor privilege fees.</p>",
    "q7":"Yes. The current balance of power between the Mayor and City Council is appropriate. The city's \"strong-Mayor\" form of government is prudent because the Mayor is the executive elected by all of the people of Baltimore, and the Mayor can be held accountable directly and individually as opposed to a diffusion of accountability. In theory, the city's \"strong-Mayor\" form of government also allows for decisions to be made and things to get done quickly that are in the best interests of the entire city. In addition, the Mayor's control over the budget thwarts the potential for fourteen different Council members to insert District pork projects into the budget.</p>",
    "q8":"Yes, but the City Council can and should take on more issues and seek to draft more legislation to make greater positive, progressive change throughout the city. The most important issues the City Council has tackled in the last four years include local hiring, banning the box, police body cameras, a plastic bags ban, funding for recreation centers, the youth investment fund, a living wage, healthy food initiatives, and livable housing.</p>",
    "q9":"City services are delivered inefficiently, the city's technology is out of date, and citizens are not always satisfied with the services they receive. To improve city response time and resident satisfaction, the city must streamline its processes, enhance its technology and information technology, and foster a culture of service and professionalism among its personnel. The city should also recharge CitiStat to facilitate oversight and accountability, information-sharing, and communication among city workers and policymakers.</p>",
    "q10":"I am running for City Council because it is time for new energy, a sense of urgency, and smart change in Baltimore City government. Baltimore City government has to do far more for the people of Baltimore. </p><p>I am proud to be from Baltimore. I grew up in Baltimore City, got a great education in the city, played on great sports teams in the city and had great neighbors, teachers, and coaches in the city. I went to law school in Baltimore City, I am a lawyer for the people of Baltimore, and my husband and I have invested as homeowners in the city. </p><p>The only way for the people of Baltimore to move forward is to come together as a spirited city-wide community. We cannot accept living, working, playing, and looking forward to the future in a city with stark disparities in opportunities in different zip codes. It is not right that Baltimore is a city of neighborhoods with clean streets, nice homes, and good schools, while also a city of neighborhoods with dirty streets, vacant houses, and subpar schools. </p><p>As a member of the City Council, I will draft and advocate for legislation that will result in a safer, cleaner, greener city with stronger schools, neighborhoods, and local businesses. I will also champion responsive, accountable, innovative, and open government.</p>"

    "q1":"Key issues in the district include high crime and property taxes, but there is a broader pressing issue that needs immediate attention. District 5 has great diversity. It has affluent, middle class and impoverished neighborhoods, each with their own priorities and concerns. There are neighborhoods where most people work, and sections where unemployment is a key concern because there aren't jobs or sufficient affordable child-care, or the residents don't have proper education or training.</p><p>The next councilperson needs to represent and fight for all of the diverse communities. While lowering crime and taxes is important, some sectors care more about good schools or affordable housing. We must be able to address all the issues, without prioritizing one sector more than another. We need short- and long-term solutions, through community partnerships, legislative, and non-legislative solutions. I am always cultivating relationships, walking the streets to hear problems, and ready to roll up my sleeves to take action. I will create opportunities and activities that bring the leaders of diverse communities together to play a hands-on role in improving relationships and, subsequently, solve some of the problems we face.</p><p>Beyond building stronger relationships within my district, I plan to establish close relationships with colleagues on the city council, brainstorming solutions that impact similar communities and exploring ways to help the entire city while prioritizing my district's needs and constituents. </p>",
    "q2":"Recent changes in police department personnel and upcoming turnover in City Hall will provide new opportunities in the fight against crime. The Governor's announcement of state funds for city police programs offers optimism, but we must continue to work with the state and federal government to tap into other funding and resources. </p><p>As an advisory board member with a local safety patrol group, as well as an appointed community liaison to the State's Attorney's office, I have first-hand seen the dramatic increase in crime in my district and fighting crime will be a priority.</p><p>While developing police-community relationships is vital, we need strategies to reduce violent crime, including sufficient resources for law enforcement. Several months ago, I suggested in a community forum that the Mayor allocate resources to expand the crime lab, which hadn't had a staff expansion since the 1970s. The mayor acted quickly and the crime lab now has the resources to treat more crime scenes. That is one of many necessary activities.</p><p>We need more police walking/riding their beats; greater police presence in the community scares off criminals while enabling local residents to increase their trust, and allows the police to learn more about the locals, their interests and their lives.</p><p>We also have to focus on alternatives to lives of crime; providing job training and work opportunities for returning residents is critical. We have some good programs, such as at Johns Hopkins Hospital, and I will work with local businesses to expand such programs and opportunities.</p>",
    "q3":"There is no shortage of lessons to be learned from Freddie Gray, many related to the need to find solutions to economic and educational disparity in urban areas. And from all I have heard, read, watched, and personally experienced, I realize that the more things have changed in Baltimore City over the years, the more things have stayed the same.</p><p>We cannot maintain the status quo of one step forward for some, two steps back for others. We can address some of the lessons from Freddie Gray, whether it is ensuring that families have affordable, healthy places to live or that children have appropriate public or charter school educations, or that there be more jobs and job training. </p><p>And we must be practical about what can succeed in the short-term versus more systemic issues that can take years to change. Ultimately, we must ensure that every resident in the city is of equal concern in the eyes of government, and we must invest more efforts, energy and resources to help some neighborhoods, kids and schools catch up to others.</p><p>We know that perception is reality, and changing the public's perception towards the city leadership (as well as the police and any \"authority\") is critical. With expected changes on the city council this year, I believe we have an opportunity to instill greater hope and optimism into Baltimore City, subsequently leading towards greater collaboration that translates into outcomes and results that are badly needed.</p>",
    "q4":"In my district, high property taxes drive families a few blocks to the county (and other families don't buy in the city. I support tax break legislation for firefighters or police officers because of the potential positive impact on the city, but we have to find broader solutions to help all local residents who face high property taxes. Tax cuts can't come at the expense of residents, by raising other taxes or fees to make up the shortfall. </p><p>I believe in short-term tax breaks for long-term benefits, so am open towards plans that offer tax benefits in exchange for enhancing city development. But it must be on a case by case basis, with analysis that realistically forecasts the financial long-term benefits for the city. For projects like Harbor Point, it is too early gauge success. I believe usually such projects can help the city, but we must plan to offer benefits to nearby communities that may not directly benefit from the broader project. </p><p>We should thoroughly review the city budget and audit agencies annually. We must explore what has successfully worked in other cities (lowering taxes and cutting the budget, without reducing important city services). There are technologies today that can reduce city costs, and we should explore them while we consider cutting property taxes or raising fees. </p><p>Government officials must realize that the citizens of Baltimore are our customers. As a business owner, I know it is cheaper to keep a customer happy than to get a new customer. </p>",
    "q5":"Programs such as Vacants to Value have benefits for Baltimore City, although we must realize that there are other non-housing changes that have to occur in the City to reap the greatest benefits from housing programs. As we move forward with such projects, we should consider recommendations from non-partial organizations, such as the Abell Foundation, which outline very specific efforts that to undertake. And there must be a long-term plan, for projects such as the Governor's, to ensure that the short-term enthusiasm does not wane if progress is slow, and that there is funding to ensure maintenance of such programs beyond the first few years.</p><p>In neighborhoods away from the waterfront, we have to create natural, green areas – including parks, which have been proven to help distressed areas. We need to ensure there is funding for maintenance and upkeep of those areas, which have benefits beyond beautifying an area; green areas can play a role in preventing obesity and asthma. </p><p>Baltimore must provide and expand financial assistance to encourage commercial revitalization, working closely with the business sector to attract companies and provide jobs, while working with educational institutions to ensure job training and educational programs for those jobs. </p><p>In particular, we should duplicate successful programs from other cities. Baltimore has to recruit and engage anchor institutions, and generate buy-in partners. Looking towards long-term success, we should focus on green jobs, and recruit, fund and support such companies that will invest in a long-term commitment to non-waterfront urban neighborhoods.</p>",
    "q6":"Baltimore City's economic development is dependent on human and non-human resources, including skilled workers, education, funding, transportation, and government policies. While Baltimore has seen a recent growth in the hotel and leisure industry (partially due to the casino and general tourist industry), that will not replace job loss, such as manufacturing or Fortune 500 companies.</p><p>Barriers to the economic development in Baltimore City includes crime and taxes, which are addressed separately in this questionnaire and which need legislative initiatives to help. Education is critical too. At the high school level, we must provide greater opportunities for students to learn skills and trade before completing 12th grade. And we must expand and develop job training programs, as well as internships and apprenticeships for local residents. We should work closely with corporations as well as the large number of colleges and universities in the greater Baltimore region to ensure that local college students are receiving training and recruitment to stay in Baltimore. </p><p>We must invest Baltimore City resources in industries that have long-term opportunities for our city, particularly green job creation, and focus on implementing job growth strategic plans – recruiting companies, training workers, etc. </p><p>Moreover, Baltimore has a growing immigrant population, and we must work to attract investors and immigrants who can fund opportunities for this population. The federal government has programs in place to attract foreign capital (foreign investors or individuals with wealth), who can create opportunities; we must explore such options.</p>",
    "q7":"Baltimore City's government structure gives significantly more power to the mayor, and I believe that there needs to be greater balance of power with the city council. Having single council districts should enable residents to have a strong voice on the city council, but it is insufficient, and we need to ensure proper representation of the local citizens and their needs. For that reason, I support efforts such as changing the number of votes needed to override the mayor's veto, effectively ensuring a greater balance between the executive and the council. </p><p>And while I believe that it is appropriate for the mayor to sit on the Board of Estimates, the mayor should not have as much power over that board as currently exists (with the mayor essentially in control of 3 of the 5 votes of the Board). The structure of the Board of Estimates is in dire need of changing.</p><p>I also believe that the city councilmembers do not have sufficient say in the budget. Particularly now, as we prepare for significant changes on the City Council and a new mayor, it is worthwhile to consider an in-depth review of the budget and a financial overhaul of the city. With regards to the council members not permitted to increase or add new items to the budget, we should be exploring whether that is in the city's best interest, or if we should change the current system. </p>",
    "q8":"I do believe that the current council has been concerned with some of the key priorities – trying to revitalize Baltimore and making it a better place to raise families. While the city budget in recent years included funding that would help in the fight against crime, better education, affordable housing, and creating a stronger fiscal environment, the city council did not do enough to implement the programs or create effective solutions. And for some of the better legislation, the implementation was not carried out well, or insufficient foresight was involved. </p><p>So while creating legislation, for example against panhandling, to improve the city, we should have solid legislation and implementation abilities to help our homeless get back on their feet or get proper mental and physical health care as we remove them from the streets they are familiar with. Another example of the right ideas but improper execution was the speed camera fiasco. We paid hundreds of thousands of dollars to get out of a contract that sold us faulty technology. And putting ads on fire trucks to prevent closure of fire stations is a band-aid approach, and does not get to the root of solving the budget crisis in Baltimore.</p>",
    "q9":"A recent failure was the 2016 blizzard. We anticipated it, but were insufficiently prepared. Local residents and businesses who could not get down their streets due to lack of clear roads were threatened with fines for not shoveling their sidewalks. The city wasn't adequately aware of what streets weren't plowed. And outside vendors are billing the city for millions of dollars and we haven't verified that the work was done properly. </p><p>City services have improved in recent years, but there are areas still lacking, such as lower levels of crime. The response time to a break-in, for example, is unacceptable. While we understand there are limited resources and the police are dealing with more serious crimes, the public must feel secure in their homes.</p><p>For non-emergency services, technology has enabled tremendous improvements; as technology advances and the city's population hopefully grows, we must ensure that our government is one step ahead – being proactive instead of waiting for the public to complain. Proper delivery of city services is a combination of management (including upgraded technology) and funding, and Baltimore City must prioritize both. </p><p>Many well-intentioned initiatives in the city have been put forward without proper planning and have tremendously lacked execution.</p><p>As an entrepreneur, I understand the need to review all aspects of every project and factor a cost-benefit analysis in conjunction with a throughout viability study. As a council member, I will protect the taxpayers' investments like I protect my own business investments for greater outcomes for Baltimore City.</p>",
    "q10":"As a local community activist and leader in Baltimore City's northwest area, I've had a front-row seat to seeing the challenges facing our community, and I have sought out solutions. For example, I learned that our city has a federally-funded summer meal program for children that has existed for many years, which expands the hot lunch school program, giving nutritious, free meals to local children. An entire segment of the district was not getting this program, which should have been available to them. I worked closely with government officials and was able to feed thousands of more local children daily.</p><p>Having a political outsider on the council – someone who runs a business while serving as a community leader – provides us that hybrid leadership we need to see and approach things from a different perspective than people who have been in government for years and have been part of the status quo.</p><p>With Baltimore City about to enter a new political era, we need a city council that can infuse bold, new ideas into the city. I am a life-long resident of the city and of the 5th Council District, and because I love the city and know it can be a great place to live and work, I have chosen to raise my family here. But coming from outside of city government, I can look at things from a different lens and improve the city, beyond the communities and neighborhoods I have been actively and effectively helping until now.</p>"

    "q1":"Recovery Programs: One the most pressing issues in the district is placing drug treatment programs in residential communities and in business districts. The major concern is human service density. Simply put too much in one neighborhood.</p><p>Brown space redevelopment is effective means to reduce human service in residential communities. </p><p>Redeveloping brown space areas that once use as light industrial area also eliminates blight which is another issue in the district. Redevelopment creates new usable space opportunities recovery programs and other human service programs. It provides new green opportunities Much of the brown space in Baltimore is already accessible to public transportation.</p><p>Community Schools: We need to get back walkable schools. Schools were students can walk to and are an engaging part of the community. As we continue to place emphasis on community school engagement we have to shift to an environment were our schools are not only educational centers but community centers like Commodore Rodgers in Southeast Baltimore.</p>",
    "q2":"No! Absolutely not. In 2015, 344 people were killed. 320 of those murders were black people. 23 of those murders were children. </p><p>We closed the year out with a clearance rate of 31%. 70% of the murders in Baltimore went unsolved. We are living in city where who would kill are killing because they know they have a 70% of never being arrested. Over 200 murderers lurk our streets. </p><p>These murder and other crimes continue to cripple our community because outside of the political opts we see Commissioner Davis, who campaigning to doing to keep his job, community engagement between the police department is the pre-Freddie Gray remains non-existent. As result police are not able to the information they need from the community to solve these murders put these in prison where they belong. </p><p>Until have leadership in the Police Department gets that crime will continue to escalate. we have to work to build a trust relationship between community and police department. </p><p>I have led conversation about community and police engagement.

His spine severed by 80% from the base of his neck. </p><p>Black people we must stop killing each other too.</p>",
    "q4":"Yes the property tax rate should be reduce. It is not a matter of how. it is matter of doing it. The current property tax rate is not reflected in city services, parks, and it is definitely not reflected in our schools that is primarily supported by the state. </p><p>TIFs should only be offered developers and companies that hire locally. Baltimore is in need of several job generating tax bases.

    "q7":"It has to change. The first place I would start in the Board of Estimates(BOE).The mayor currently has absolute power. Everyone on the BOE would have autonomy from the Mayor.

Get creative and help pass an anti-noise ordinance, update housing codes, and include drug-free clauses in rental agreements.

Its important for the developer to build trust and plan to build an open communication with surrounding community associations and residents so that plans do not drive out lower-income people and result in complete gentrification. Inclusionary housing should be brought to the discussions.</p>",
    "q5":"The entire 6th District is away from the waterfront and major revitalization efforts have been continuing for many years in the District. Many of the tenants and homeowners continue to use much of their salaries on housing costs. That's why now, its so important to put focus on permanent affordable housing options. Baltimore should continue it's greening strategies ranging from urban farming,repairing community parks, and planning building of green certified properties. Demolition and acquisition should continue but, implementation of human service needs of residents that have built a vested interest for many years in the community, must continue to be provided with access to schools, goods and services, community centers,etc. While there is more work to do, progress continues, as long as there are combined partnerships with the City agencies, Community,Businesses, Faith based, Schools,etc.</p>",
    "q6":"Barriers- having a lack of qualified job readiness training/skills, and chronic financial instability. Address by encouraging extensive ties to organizations that could provide training, apprenticeship training, provide other services to residents, like on-site job centers, to help them advance along career pathways with a decent living wage.This includes at-risk youth, incarceration, youth who have not graduated high school, or adults who have experienced homelessness. Also, support raising the minimum wage to $15 per hour.</p>",
    "q7":"As a City Council member, I works with residents issues on a day-to-day bases and have a great amount of input in decisions that effect the communities I represent. As, a member of committees such as, the Land Use and Transportation Committee, working on the Transform Baltimore Zoning re-writes, and Chairperson of Urban Affairs and Aging approving urban renewal plans, I have a chance to express concerns effecting communities, especially suggested changes within the last 40 years. This is one balancing effort attempt. But truly not enough. Today's power is still Mayoral driven. One consideration I have been studying, would be to equalize voting power on the Board of Estimates. Communication is the key between both forms of government (Administrative and Legislative) at all times.</p>",
    "q8":"Yes, within limitations of power. Public Safety; such as, efforts for implementation of the body camera program, police brutality concerns and awareness, tracking police overtime spending. Education; such as quarterly reviews of 21st Century Schools funding/closures, successful restoring of State funding for Senior Centers and awareness of their formula change, the Youth Works awareness/hiring of more youth for summer program initiative, legalization of same sex marriage, imposing curfews and creating of curfew centers for youth. Transform Baltimore Zoning Code; continue rewrites and amendment implementation for communities, Health Disparities; increased enforcement or closures of food establishments not in compliance. Many investigative hearings; from strengthening utility/water bill assistance, homelessness population concerns, city agency process and audits on a regular bases, proper implementation of \"smart meters\", TIF's or subsides granted such as,Harbor Point project. Code enforcement on advertising of drug paraphernalia in windows of businesses; Businesses required to hire a percentage of Baltimore City residents / minorities on contracts; Employee Pension System and government agency privatization issues.</p>",
    "q9":"A need for better communications outreach and a follow-up plan for services to assist. Lack of Code Enforcement Inspectors- Allocate more funding for Inspectors to investigate and resolve 311 calls and issues from residents in a timely manner. Share best practices and exchange ideas from other cities. Also Coordinate and with other agencies.</p>",

    "q1":"The most pressing issues are unemployment, affordable housing and crime in the district. I would address those issues by informing residents about job training and employment opportunities in the district. I would also be a strong supporter of an expansion of community schools in the district as a way to better serve children and to engage families who may be too busy to attend neighborhood meetings. I would also work with the police department to increase neighborhood patrols to more effectively identify criminal activity that occurs in select hot spots throughout the district.</p>",
    "q2":"I do not think that the city is employing the right strategy. I believe that the city should target those individuals who repeatedly commit violent crime. This isn't simply to continue to arrest them, but also to provide treatment to those who need it and to identify ways that we may steer non-violent offenders away from committing crime in the first place. Also, police should have an ongoing dialogue with young people and other community residents to begin to develop relationships and to listen to the community's concerns about officers who are \"bad apples\". This will build trust and lead to better cooperation when information is needed from the community.</p>",
    "q3":"The first lesson is that wholesale neighborhoods in Baltimore have been neglected for years. That neglect has also been compounded by crime. The city seems to have turned a blind eye to years of police abuse and corruption that occurred in Sandtown-Winchester. When one drills deeper into root causes of the Uprising, you find that the community was promised millions of dollars in federal funding during the 1990's through the Empowerment Zone. However, there were only pockets of success and residents were left on the sidelines as others scrambled for the dollars and left when the money stopped flowing. What is troubling is that this occurrence is now being combined with displacement to make matters worse in other areas of the city.</p>",
    "q4":"I am not in favor of another property tax cut. We should attract more residents by improving on conditions in the city and the quality of our schools. Tax increment financing has had some success at generating development, but we must be sure to limit the unintended consequence of reducing the amount of state funding for city schools.</p>",
    "q5":"The city must look to promote programs like Healthy Neighborhoods and Live Baltimore that encourage more people to consider moving into the city. Vacants to Value is a mixed bag at this time. It has been one of Mayor Rawlings-Blake's signature initiatives and has shown some promise, but there are still way too many vacant properties in the city. While there are stories of vacant houses moving swiftly from neglect to being renovated and occupied, there are other stories of preperties that still sit idle while the process moves slowly. I do recognize that any effort that combats blight, whether it is local, state or federal, needs to be applauded. However, looking at it from the perspective of a homeowner who lives in a community where vacant houses are a major problem, it should not take decades to get action.</p>",
    "q6":"The chief barriers are the public's perception of shopping in certain areas of the city, the economy and the persistent crime that seems to plague inner-city communities in Baltimore. It is difficult to convince someone to locate a business in a community where there are few people to serve or the people who that business targets will go elsewhere for that service. Clearly there is no simple answer to this problem, but we must bring new businesses to meet members of the community and promote those businesses as often as possible. We must also make sure that the Baltimore Development Corporation offers meaningful assistance to those businesses to help them to stay afloat during the critical first and second years of operation. Finally, we need to encourage more schools to offer class credits for student internships to teach youth marketable skills that will introduce them to a career.</p>",
    "q7":"We have a strong mayor system. The only change that I would make is that I would change the makeup of the Board of Estimates. I believe that the Mayor should appoint 1 member (City Solicitor) and the City Council should vote in 1 member to go with the Council President and the City Comptroller's seat on the board. My proposal would need to be approved as a Charter Amendment.</p>",
    "q8":"The Baltimore City Council has allowed itself to become less relevant over the years. Unfortunately the public does not look to the council for action, because the council seems to be unable to make things happen that yield real benefits to the people. The most important issues that the City Council has dealt with over the last few years have been the Mayor's proposal to close several recreation centers, last year's vote on the police commissioner, and Council President Young's plan to set aside funding for youth programming. I think that the City Council gets fair marks on those issued, because it went against the will of the people allowing many centers to be closed, then overruled the vocal opposition by approving the selection of Commissioner Davis as our police commissioner. However, the council seems to be getting it right on the issue of funding for youth programming by seeking to override the Mayor's objection to setting aside additional funding in the city's budget for youth programming.</p>",
    "q9":"While I think that 311 is effective, I recognize that more needs to be done to improve on the delivery of services. Anyone who is hired to answer calls must be aware of how the process works. The system is bogged down by workers who don't thoroughly investigate a citizen's claim and instead close the file by stating that the issue was resolve when clearly it has not been resolved. Just as many residents seek for police to have body cameras, it might also be good for employees from Housing, DPW, Recreation and Parks as well as other agencies to have cameras that provide visual feedback to the public that the problem has been solved.</p>",
    "q10":"I am running for office, because I know that I have the education as well as professional and people skills that it takes to connect with people of different backgrounds. This will allow me to involve more residents in the political process and bring attention to issues that our current councilwoman does not approach.</p>"

    "q1":"I live in the 7th District and have for most of my life. The same region where the riots related to Freddie Gray occurred. The conditions are socioeconomic. The three most crucial issues facing my constituents are: A.) inequality = those who get the chance for better Vs. those who want to make things better but never get the opportunity to do so. B.) inequity = Those who have no viable means of self-worth through employment , skills or work jobs without a union to add a feeling of contribution to a trade or profession. C.) instability = Those who have no certainty about a job ,which causes uncertainty in the family, which causes uncertainty among social peers, which causes individuals to be easily influenced to do something they would not do if they had steady employment. The only way to address these issues is systematically. These issues are the major connections which build the bridges to many crimes.</p>",
    "q2":"I strongly support our men and women in uniform because being a Marine I understand the stresses and real danger involved. I also understand that it is a thankless job. I support getting Baltimore's most violent offenders off of our streets. However, I think the problems of the judicial system need reform. When officers apprehend violent offenders the loop holes in our systems let them back on the streets. Many times to do more crime even while waiting to go back to court. In the past we have seen many cases where violent offenders have committed heinous crimes after being convicted and imposed with light sentences of other violent crimes. This was true when officer Chestly was killed in an attempted robbery in the 7th district. The offender who had enough priors and was waiting for a court date shot and killed officer Chestly. These loop holes poses a huge risk to public safety and more importantly the judicial structure around witness cooperation and juror participation. We need to probe beneath the surface to understand why the concerns of the bench is different in Baltimore City as opposed to the decisions handed out by benches in surrounding counties. I propose that we build foster healthy positive relationships between police and citizens. The best way to do this I feel is to have \"meet the community meetings\".This way officers will know who lives in the region and who is suspiciously hanging around for reasons of possible ill intent.</p>",
    "q3":"The question is not so much as to what I have learned but what has the community learned. The death of Michael Brown and the Ferguson riots; preceding Freddie Gray was still lingering in the minds of many Americans. When Freddie Gray died a phrase was \"coined\" denoting a self-centered mind set. From those two events a slogan that \"Black lives matter\" drew national attention. The fact is that all lives matter. Yes, black lives matter and the only ones who don't realize it are those who commit senseless violence of rape, robbery and murder. Every rape impacts a life, every robbery and every murder. The mindset that someone other than those who commit these heinous crimes is responsible for the degradation in our communities is absurd. White police officers, businessmen and republicans are not the perpetrators of these egregious acts in our communities. It's like hitting your thumb with a hammer then blaming the hammer for causing the pain. What did come to the forefront are the unfortunate disparities and inequalities which have produced these unfortunate events. What I have learned is that our youth have reacted more violently then I have ever seen. In addition I have learned such behavior must never happen again. They must be given accessibility to constructive opportunities and I belong to B.U.I.L.D which is one of the parts of B.U.I.D is the Baltimore Youth Organizing Project which helps to mentor future leaders. I plan to channel the energy for constructive training programs. </p>",
    "q4":"Let's face it the American dream is not working very clearly in district 7 and governmental taxation is part of the reason. I and anyone who rides through most of the 7th district can see it is suffering. Properties are falling down because people can't get the funds to make repairs. The problem is exacerbated by increasing taxes on those who clearly are struggling. The few regions which are able to pay the taxes are being drained of resources which might be needed for emergencies in their lives and those of family members. I believe the city's property tax rate needs to be reduced and I have already began working on strategies to give stability to the city without tax increase. I have been a long time forecaster, a skill learned in logistics; as such I am committed to continuous development of economic growth and innovative solutions to cut our over-inflated rates. In my assessment of district deterioration and economic decline I realize that property taxes are the number one reason for our shrinking middle-class population. We are at a critical cross roads and we must choose the correct path, by electing someone savvy at new policy development and not following a failed status quo. We must develop programs to help and encourage growing young families to stay in the city. We have to develop policies that offer incentives to individuals , business and Labor who are committed to a better city and policies to hold vacant property owners accountable.</p>",
    "q5":"First it must be community based, that means the community must have an interest enough to be part of the process. This community-based Plan should be the product of a realistic three-year partnership with community members, resident groups and city and elected officials. From this thoughtful and comprehensive blueprint, we can and will create economic, social and educational opportunities for the people of West Baltimore. </p><p>I am a Public Administration major and I assisted in some of the Park-height renovation planning. I also wrote policies and procedure manuals for Baltimore City. The plan must highlight a set of goals and objectives that will serve as a guide to shape future policy and activities over the next ten to twenty years. The Plan should lay out a framework of strategies that capitalize on the neighborhood's many resources and assets, with the goal of creating a more socially and economically healthy community.</p><p>Strengthening and improving the seventh district will not only serve the community within its own boundaries, it will also create connections to the larger city and the region. A key component of this Plan must be governance and implementation structure that allows for active participation by the community. By working with the city, residents will be involved in advancing the Plan's objectives such as the development of important land parcels, the creation of economic development initiatives and the provision of new job opportunities. </p><p>Vacants to values is workable. Proper abatement must be environmentally safe asbestos and lead must be contained.</p>",
    "q6":"Without reviewing the entirety of problematic socioeconomic flaws; the same inequity, inequality and instability is prevalent in the district. There are very minuet regional exceptions to this statistical fact. The average citizen of Baltimore's seventh district eats, sleeps and showers with high unemployment, decaying vacant properties, and high degrees of despondency. All three problems of unemployment, vacant demotivating communities, and hopelessness must be removed. In order to begin a method of redress, economic revitalization needs to take place which will stimulate community cohesiveness and restore a sense of community pride. </p><p>My interest is in the entire city but my focus is on my district and the improvement of it. By partnering with training organizations, organizations of skill trades I plan to make jobs available to my area residents. If a revitalization project is scheduled for five years, then an individual or individuals can learn and earn for five years. We must invest in training a workforce that is educated and equipped to perform the jobs essential to innovations of revitalization of the communities. Innovative concepts and realities of green environments and energy recycling should be some of the earliest building designs. This will in turn attract more businesses to Baltimore. We must streamline programs for small business development by offering assistance with forms etc. Matching municipal loans and tax breaks to help establish small business in communities.</p>",
    "q7":"There are generally five styles of municipal government utilized in the United States: mayor-council, council-manager, town meeting, commission, and representative town meeting. Different regions use different types which might largely depend upon the population size of the township. The most larger or rapid growing cities and townships or boroughs have adopted either of two forms of municipal government. These two types of municipal governance are: mayor-council or council-manager. Under Baltimore city's governmental structure, the mayor and city council are separate with the council selecting their own presiding officer known as council President and setting their own agenda. The mayor has the authority to appoint department directors and has veto authority. However, the council has mayor veto override authority. Additionally, the mayor proposes the city budget, but it is up to the council to approve it. </p><p>This structure places the Mayor in a position where he or she is directly accountable to voters and can implement the majority viewpoint faster. This means that they should quickly react to citizen concerns. It is the mayor's office that is responsible for management duties such as operations, administration, and budgets. It is also the mayor who has veto power. Having a single voice in office places the mayor in a position to articulate a vision and act on it. This structure makes it easy to understand who is in charge, giving the city a single point person to handle constituencies and various groups that increase as the city grows. I would not change it. </p>",
    "q8":"#1.crime-fighting and public safety. I place this as a priority without crime control there is no quality of security. The crime Murder rate escalates every year. ( No Progress )</p><p>#2 City workers losing jobs due to budget cuts. Entire department under Baltimore city government have been down sized or even abolished; this because of failure to secure plausible contracts for workers. This has caused hardship through loss of credit rating and mortgages and disrupted family structures. </p><p>#3. Property taxes had become a major concern as to reduction. The government requires taxes to pay employees, in theory. So, then if there are less employees to pay why should taxes increase? The taxes have gone up.</p><p>#4. Vacant deteriorating houses. I love the vacants to values however; I am not seeing much progress with this program. Although the Mayor borrowed my idea she never took the time to learn how it is supposed to work.</p><p>#5. reforms in the Baltimore City schools. We are tearing down and closing schools, and are increasingly moving towards more privatizing concepts which threaten more jobs </p><p>These are some of the issues which I feel should have made progress but has not. They were concerns and still are. The council has not performed as well as citizens have hoped over the last four years. </p>",
    "q9":"The biggest concern with city services is the neutral competence .The representativeness is missing. By this I mean when a citizen calls or writes it is because they need help. We are in the business of helping citizens that is our profession, but that is all to often the element missing. There is no professionalism. When I work with someone I represent the agency's best. When people call they ask for Mr. Asa , or Mr. Antonio because I am that personable. There seems to be a blight of mediocrity in customer services and that includes all city jobs, they are a service to the public. The business is Public Administrations. During my tenure with Baltimore city I supervised the procurement and safety activities of 64 programs and 17 delegate agencies. I developed clear guidelines for expected performance. I monitored the performance of those programs and agencies to assure compliance and the highest possible standards were being performed. Progress meetings are essential and a system of checks and balances to assure the work is being done. There is an old saying \"If you want something done right do it yourself\". I am a very hands on leader. I want to know each detail and concern because that is a part of conflict resolution and good customer service. When I am elected I will work to resolve any and all of the various community issues I solemnly swear.</p>",
    "q10":"This is not my first run it is about the third time. My life, educational and professional background has prepared me to serve on the City Council. Although, I have a proven ability to write and develop governmental policies and procedures I did it for more than five years. I have a listening ear and a reputation for bringing resolve to matters of concern. I have always been a champion for the right things. I believe my energy and interpersonal skills will allow me to effectively work with our Mayor and City Council members as well as citizens, business, and labor communities to move the District 7 forward towards a much needed and long overdue , revitalization renaissance of Beauty and Education. Lastly, I see our youth as being our most valuable resource. We are failing the youth. I am a member of B.U.I.L.D, within that unit there is a group of impressive young people more than 250 from every middle and High school in Baltimore. This inner group is known as BYOP. These Boys and Girls are from various ethnic backgrounds and religious faiths but, they all have the same concerns: bullying, inactivity, and employment programs which should coincide with school. The \" Freddie Gray riots\" were in the seventh district and were initiated by the youth of this city. Knowing and understanding these and matters of crime ,which directly target and plague our elderly persons in subsidized high rises is what drives me to seek a solution; and that come by getting elected and empowered to make a change for the better.</p>"

    "q2":"Baltimore needs, and I will fight for:</p><p>1. Better Police Oversight – The City recently agreed to a phased roll-out of body cameras, but this is not enough. Each and every member of the police should have body cameras equipped on day one of the program. Moreover, grievances with the police must be treated with the respect they deserve. The City must overhaul its entire Civilian Review Board process to serve.</p><p>2. More Comprehensive Diversion and Treatment Programs – Most drug-related crimes within the City are due to a toxic mix of addiction and trauma. Many of our children have sadly grown up with limited opportunities and abusive households. Studies have shown that adults with these backgrounds are much more likely to commit crime. We should look not to incarcerate these individuals, but treat the issues that cause them to commit crimes over and over again. No sober-minded individual wants to be an addict. and,</p><p>3. A Diverse Police Force – The City recently adopted a \"community policing\" model. This means that officers are charged with policing only a single neighborhood in order to build a relationship with residents. These officers, however, come from surrounding counties, and even Pennsylvania and other states. The City must make a better effort to recruit from within the City so that officers reflect the values of community members, and one more City resident</p>",

Indeed, there are two very distinct communities, with completely different socio-economic realities and challenges, which manifest themselves in how each community is policed, and their relationship(s) with and expectations of, the criminal justice system (just to name two examples of the differences). </p><p>The pain, anger and frustration which boiled over, over those days in late April, were inevitable. Freddie Gray's death merely provided the spark for that which followed. However, I view this experience as a necessary step in the healing, recovery and rehabilitation process, because before there can be progress, there ofttimes must be pain. </p><p>The question remains, however, do political representatives, government, community leaders, non-profits, and other stakeholders, have the vision, courage and commitment necessary to finally confront the systemic ills which plague our failed policing strategies?</p>",
    "q4":"In order to encourage economic development and attract new city residents via home ownership, reducing Baltimore's property tax rate, must be high on our agenda. To do so, The Mayor and City Council must balance graduated reductions in the rate with a commitment to more responsible and efficient government spending.</p><p>With respect ro TIF, PILOTS, etc., I am not opposed to such as a rule, but cannot support any deal unless said agreements are matched with certain conditions. </p><p>I believe it is the City's obligation to ensure that it receives the best possible value for any agreement that it strikes with private parties. In exchange for economic development monies, the City should require that beneficiaries provide prevailing wages for their employees and sub-contractors. I would support legislation to this effect.</p>",
    "q5":"Our vibrant communities have the capacity to thrive. For this to happen, we need smart investments in:</p><p>Economic Incubators – Our community's ideas need nurturing, and incubators provide a workspace for innovation to thrive. Here, members of the community with plans for a business will have access to the necessary capital, tools, and guidance from successful mentors. In other districts, incubators have shown resounding success because of the investment made by the University of Maryland and Johns Hopkins, along with a number of local businesses.</p><p>Job Training – In recent years, the City has shifted toward providing practical jobs training to each Baltimore City resident in need. However, access to this training is usually limited. We need to provide training where residents actually are, and expand the amount of employers willing to hire those that have completed job training.</p><p>As far as Governor Hogan's plan, I believe that the devil is in the details, particularly with regards to funding sources as it appears that he is not, in fact, providing new sources of funding, but rather, simply shifting previously budgeted money around. Also, tearing down buildings is not the end all solution. The real question remains: what will be done with these empty spaces after the dilapidated buildings are razed? That remains to be seen.</p>",
    "q6":"There are more than a few barriers to economic development in Baltimore. Of utmost importance, there are few financial institutions willing to invest in upstart businesses, especially in minority communities. The City can intervene by securing, along with its local financial institutions, loans to entrepreneurs that have solid business plans. As Councilman, I would sponsor legislation to this effect. </p><p>We must stop shifting wealth from other parts of the state or country, and begin developing it here at home. Moreover, the City must invest in creating a job-ready workforce. Additional money should be diverted toward educating our youth in secondary school, community college and vocational/trade schools, with the ultimate goal of encouraging youngsters to pursue higher learning. During budget hearings, I will place a great emphasis on this concept. Our youth need skills to help them today, but must continue to aspire for greatness. </p><p>It's well overdue that this city commit itself to investing in it's people, not just buildings.</p>",
    "q7":"The current balance between the mayor and City Council disproportionately favors the mayor. This system is sometimes referred to as a \"mayor strong\" government. In hearing from constituents and other concerned citizens across the City, I have learned that many feel disenfranchised by the current system. Our City is diverse and has diverse interests, and we must entrust our Council members, each of whom is much more attuned to the needs of individual neighborhoods, to make policy. I would suggest allowing for greater Council representation on the Board of Estimates, establishing more Council-appointed seats on all Citywide task forces and boards, and lowering the threshold for mayoral veto overrides. These reforms can be achieved through resolutions establishing ballot referendums.</p>",
    "q8":"The City Council is almost always focused on the right issues. The bigger issue is that its focus is always captured after the fact and that focus quickly erodes. I do believe, however, that not enough attention has been paid to our noncompetitive property tax rates. I believe this has caused stable and affluent residents, as well as minority, \"millennial\", or otherwise, to leave. </p><p>Over the last four years, there have been numerous worthwhile causes brought forth by the Council including efforts to encourage our Annapolis delegation to work on revising the police bill of rights,holding the education and police budgets accountable, and funding for recreation centers. Again, these issues need greater attention and I would shine a spotlight on them and strongly advocate for their implementation.</p>",
    "q9":"Most who receive adequate city services. Unfortunately, there are some residents that are left out in the cold, sometimes literally, receiving unacceptable inadequate service. Our City workforce is great, but our methodology is flawed. The recent Department of Transportation audit revealed that workers do not have the tools to efficiently register and catalog pertinent information. This, in turn, results in managers that are incapable of tracking items such as response time, resident satisfaction, and even completed work. The City can and must do better, by adopting a universally compatible, department-specific, and easily accessible database(s) from which all workers and citizens can access and assess the progress of City services. Moreover, it would be highly beneficial if the City would be open to diverting some Citistat resources towards ensuring that data is inputted on a regular basis.</p>",
    "q10":"I am running to represent the citizens of the 7th Councilmanic District because I believe that we can build a stronger and more vibrant Baltimore if we put People Before Politics. The 7th district and Baltimore City are in crisis. We can no longer ignore the systemic conditions which gave rise to the explosion of last April. We need strong, committed leadership, ready to challenge the status quo to secure necessary resources and support for the struggling communities of West Baltimore.</p>"

    "q1":"Trash/rodents, drugs, arbitrary city fines and permit restrictions, violent crime, burglaries, vacant/decaying housing, and unemployment. All are addressed in the responses to these questions. I do want to mention that my approach to crime in Question 2 is presented as an additional option to the traditional methods on the table. It is not meant to replace other traditional methods.</p>",
    "q2":"Solving violent crime should be simpler. Find the small percentage of people who are committing the crimes, and put them in jail. Most of Baltimore's neighborhoods are arranged in a way that everybody sees everything (narrow streets, dense row housing, stoops, etc.) It is very difficult to commit a violent crime in public, and not have people see it. Not only that, most violent criminals are not that smart, and will talk about what they have done in order to increase their credibility on the street. The end result is that many people in the neighborhood know who his committed crimes in their area, and some know firsthand.</p><p>For these reasons, I believe that Baltimore should lead the country in efforts to encourage witnesses to speak. I recognize that this requires a cultural shift, and it will not be easy. However, we can make the process easier. The first step would be a marketing campaign involving hip-hop artists, r&b artists, and other celebrities that would encourage people who witness a crime to come forward. The second step is having multiple discreet and anonymous ways of contacting the police department and giving detailed information. The third would be to update our witness protection program, so that those who came forward to reveal their identity and testify could receive quick placement in a recently renovated vacant home owned by the city, and opportunities through the city to transfer their employment, or receive funds to move out of the city as needed.</p>",
    "q3":"To enforce the law, you have to know it, and the procedure to enforce it. Passing field and paper tests that demonstrate a solid understanding of police procedure and criminal law (including recent changes to each) should be a quarterly requirement, and necessary for promotions or salary increases. Police that don't pass repeated tests should be placed on administrative leave and given tutoring until they pass. Properly-trained police officers are more likely to use force only when absolutely necessary, and they will almost never injure suspects once they are in custody. However, this level of training requires constant learning and re-learning of proper techniques to address changes in criminal law and procedure. Officers must constantly be tested (on paper and in the field) on all police procedures, and should be trained to correct any co-workers, even supervisors, when they see violations of the rules. </p><p>In the Gray case, the officers either ignored or didn't understand their General Orders for a basic task: transporting a suspect. Does responsibility for this go all the way to the top? Absolutely. Continuing education MUST be a basic part of any police officer's job. Salaries for police officers must be competitive - their job is very hard here.</p><p>The protests were not just about Gray or excessive police force. They were about a vast segment of Baltimore that feels as if they don't matter. They can't get decent jobs, and are completely excluded from the system.</p>",
    "q4":"TIFs and other tax-related financial tools are not evil or good; it is the entire deal that must be evaluated on its merits. A TIF could be used as part of a very positive or negative deal for the city's disenfranchised, depending on how the deal is structured. I would not outlaw TIFs or any other methods to finance development, but I would closely evaluate every developer deal, whether it has TIFs or not, to ensure that each deal provides substantial (not just token) benefits to areas of the city that are not part of the development. I would also want to take special precautions, using collateral, to ensure that the city would not suffer in the event of developer default.</p><p>The focus on growth only through developer deals is short-sighted. Baltimore needs organic growth in its neighborhoods, and the City can stimulate this growth. I discuss ways for the City to promote organic growth throughout this response.</p><p>Also, Baltimore should definitely reduce its system of random, ridiculous penalties and fines, many of which are equivalent to taxes because they can be unavoidable and are a natural result of living in the city. The fines are much more dangerous than taxes, however, because they cannot be predicted or budgeted. Speed cameras should never come back (speed humps reduce speed quite well), and all types of \"ambush\" fines should be eliminated to the extent possible, as many Baltimore residents are one check away from financial disaster.</p>",
    "q5":"High, random fines, long waits, and an uncaring government are a huge obstacle to Baltimore residential and small business revitalization.. The City currently makes it quite difficult for people to renovate and maintain their homes and businesses in a manner that is safe for the neighborhood.</p><p>Permit office waits should never be more than 20 minutes total, and the entire permitting office needs to be immediately revamped with a focus on online service, citizen education and getting properties safely up to code. Residents should be educated on registration and other rules that can result in $500.00 fines without notice. Unnecessary permits, such as one for a front residential door, should be abolished. We should waive ECB fines for sub-code properties when owner demonstrates the same amount was paid toward renovation. We should prohibit ECB fines without a warning period and chance to cure the problem, to the maximum extent possible while maintaining safety. Tax sales of homes should not occur without actual service on the resident or designee, or a fixed sign-posting period at the property. The Council should consider increasing the $200.00 floor on tax sales to $1,500.00, which will prevent thousands of people from paying harsh penalties to remove their properties from tax sale unnecessarily (money that would often go towards renovation). The City shall maintain a database of all fees and fines on a particular property at all times, so that an owner may pay all his City obligations at once at any time of the year. </p>",
    "q6":"Addressing unemployment is critical. Anyone who is in jail should have the opportunity to learn trades (such as home renovation) during his/her incarceration, with the goal of receiving some type of certification before they leave prison. At-risk youth and adults should have the same opportunity. A list of these of these potential contractors that shows customer feedback can allow them to market themselves immediately upon release.</p><p>Customer service in Baltimore government doesn't exist. There is absolutely no desire throughout the City to provide people with complete answers to their questions, and the normal response to a phone question is \"you'll have to come in and talk to us.\" E-mailing the City is also very unreliable. Businesses and citizens must be able to receive complete answers to their questions via email, fax, and phone whenever possible so they don't have to lose income from work to get their questions answered. It should never be hard to pay the City what it's owed. I've waited for hours myself just to find out the nature of the fines and fees that had been levied on my property. No one should ever pay a parking ticket obtained while waiting in line to do business with the City (a time-stamped ticket can be provided to people that enter and exit the Municipal building that will dismiss the parking violation). City employees should be retrained to solve a citizen's problem and get his/her questions answered. All agencies of the city must share information electronically.</p>",
    "q7":"The balance of power is a very dynamic issue that often depends on the Mayor and City Council members who occupy the office at a particular time, so I will reserve judgment on this question. However, I will say that in areas where the Mayor does not show leadership, I will use every means available to encourage solutions at the Council level.</p>",
    "q8":"I think they have some good ideas, but as you can see from my response, they aren't always addressing the easy problems right in front of their faces. However, there are many issues to address, and their time is limited. I believe that City Council meetings should be streamlined with a focus on solving problems, voting, debating, or hearing from residents, as opposed to giving long speeches thanking endless people for the opportunity to speak.</p>",
    "q9":"City residents should never have difficulty legally getting rid of trash, but it is much tougher than it has to be in Baltimore. Use strategically-placed large metal bins that give dumpers an option to dump at legal collection points (metal bins that will bar rodents). Automate bulk trash pickup at these large metal bins without the need for residents to make an appointment. Place garbage cans on every second block of North Avenue and certain other main streets to give walkers an option for tossing their handheld trash. Reduce or waive restrictions on landfills as much as possible, especially for home renovators. We should consider methods of fining actual trash dumpers (which the City does poorly), as opposed to non-dumping property owners (which the City does quite well).</p><p>Open-air drug dealing is everywhere. People should be able to dial a three to four number code on their phones that will provide police with the location of a drug deal (or any crime) without having to speak a word. Dispatchers should have access to this information and use it to route cops on their normal patrols.</p><p>Citizens need education to understand that police and other city employees have a disciplinary process, and they need to know how to use this process when they aren't receiving services they need. </p><p>Property inspections must not require an up to eight-hour wait, as many currently do now. This is a tremendous obstacle to progress and organic growth. Two hours maximum.</p><p>Neighborhood cameras must remain on.</p>",
    "q10":"Problems abound in Baltimore, but I want to begin picking the \"low-hanging fruit.\" There are tremendous amount of relatively easy solutions that can quickly improve quality of life and create an atmosphere for natural growth of the city with little effort. These problems have been neglected by the political establishment for years. As a councilman, I want to quickly fix the issues that are easy to resolve, and learn while I move on to approach the more difficult ones with a methodical approach. </p><p>If you are a resident of District 7, you should expect to see an increase in your property value by 20% over two years from the date I am able to implement the majority of the reforms I discuss here. The increase will result from creation of a more favorable atmosphere for 1) people to bring their vacant properties to code, and 2) for residents to comfortably and safely live in properties once renovated. The idea is to promote \"organic\" growth: growth that encourages potential and current property owners to renovate quickly and naturally, without the need for special efforts by the City. This growth will occur naturally because of the City's far below-market property prices, and proximity to the nation's capital. Currently, the City currently works against this growth, as I will discuss.</p>"

I plan to work with BPD and the leaders of the Western District to help bring about community policing so that residents and business feel free to work and play in the 7th District. The crime patterns in my District is sickening, increased patrols and presence in certain areas will help decrease this violence. After the brut cancellation of the RedLine here in Baltimore there is an urgent need for connected Mass Transit that can move residents around Baltimore and other cities efficiently. If elected I will put together a District Technology committee to help bring technology upgrades such as more LED lighting, Wi-fi on transit and public parks such as Druid Hill Park. Last but MOST important on my platform is Education, I want to press city leaders and the council to put more money into our City School System and go to an elected school board.

As a Council Member I would like to see more foot patrols in high crime and drug areas, I would advocate for the P.A.L.S program or one similar to come back into our Recreation Centers and Schools. If Youth and Police positively engage at an early age it could health strengthen trust and understating of police.

When the riots broke out I was actively engaging my students to look into the meaning of protest and how students and youth have been instrumental in civil rights issues in the pass. As a millennial in this city I can attest to the stagnate out dated systems of governing in Baltimore, we want a fresh approach with new leaders and vision.

The current city council is out of touch with the real issues and needs of Baltimore Citizens.</p>",
    "q9":"City services are not delivered fairly in Baltimore, certain areas get better delivery and access to services than poorer neighborhoods. A major breakdown in city services is the customer service aspect which makes residents less likely to report problems. I would like to see all city employees take a customer service and diversity training. Baltimore needs to start scoring agencies based on response times and making agency managers salary merit base to make sure agencies are ran effectively.</p>",

We need to prioritize and find the funding to make sure they are best equipped and trained to deal with the challenges of modern policing in an effective, efficient, and just/fair manner. We also must make sure they receive mental health care and support needed when they encounter traumatic situations on the job that may affect their ability to serve the community.</p><p>But we must demand accountability from them. They should be professionals who are here to serve the community. We are supposed to have a system where people are innocent until proven guilty. For this system to work, citizens, including those accused of a crime, have to make it home safely and have their day in court. Freddie Gray's death showed that our system is trending wrong with how police treat citizens and often fail to ensure their safety once in custody.</p>",
    "q4":"I am intrigued by the property tax cut proposal put forth by Nick Mosby. </p><p>My research at Brown University was regarding Lead Paint Poisoning as a policy issue. Lead poisoning is correlated with loss of I.Q., loss of income, trouble with conflict resolution, and various other behavioral issues including predispositions to violent behavior, delinquency, drug addiction, etc.</p><p>My interest in this topic also led me towards a broader awareness of the need for healthy housing overall.</p><p>It is my position that there is no point to affordable housing if it is not healthy housing, and vice versa. Unhealthy homes poison our young people and their families, costing our healthcare system and causing neurological issues that hurt our students and reduce the value/capacity of our workforce. If elected, I would like to work with whoever is the Mayor and my fellow Council members to tie grants, tax breaks, and other financial incentives (such as PILOT's and TIF's) to rules, including inclusionary zoning or rent controlled units, that set aside affordable healthy housing in new developments. We cannot price the community out of newly built healthy housing, and we should not support development that does so. I applaud the recent announcement by our City Council President to create a new standard of connecting TIFs to community funding. We need a healthy housing hotline for citizens to report unsafe or unhealthy housing conditions.</p><p>Overall, any property tax cut and any support of redevelopment should to be tied to goals for healthy, affordable housing.</p>",
    "q5":"We should continue the demolition of vacant and dilapidated homes alongside redevelopment efforts that include affordable, healthy housing. I support an expansion of the Vacants to Value program and the Live Baltimore Grants program(uncapping the # of grants available), alongside increased demolition within Mayor Rawlings-Blake's current vision. The programs work, we just need MORE of them. As a citizen, attending Live Baltimore events, there was often only 5 or 10 $5,000 grants available at a time to those who wanted to live within the city. That should be uncapped - anyone who wants to buy a home in the City and stay for a minimum of 5 years deserves this small assistance without it being a sort of lottery or wait list situation.</p><p>In addition, while I'm disappointed about the red-line, I do support Governor Hogan's decision to allocate 700 million dollars towards demolition in the city. Blight elimination via demolition, alone, is not a solution, but it certainly is part of the solution.</p><p>The Council and the Mayors Office must work with and through DHCD, BCHD, and a revived CitiStat to create a robust healthy housing stat, which would push existing programs in health and housing to improved effective and efficiency</p>",
    "q6":"1) healthy affordable housing is key to healthy and productive students, who become healthy and productive workers.</p><p>2) Government needs to do more to attract businesses to the City beyond tax giveaways, and increased public safety and reduced violent crime is key. We also need to remove bureaucratic hurdles that make starting a new business in City less attractive. </p><p>3) We need to invest in our youth and our workforce overall; we must consider options to help provide guaranteed college scholarship opportunities for our youth.</p><p>Say Yes to Education is a organization the City should re-consider partnering with, if plans are not currently moving forward. Say Yes aims to create an endowment funded college scholarship program for City Student who graduate from high school with certain minimum requirements.</p><p>This endowment will require City funding as well as funding from the private sector partners, foundations, and other non-profit organizations. </p><p>Say Yes would motivate students academically to graduate high school while meeting requirements to receive the scholarship. This also may be a great motivator to reduce flight from the BCPSS, reducing economic and racial segregation in schools.</p><p>If Say Yes fails to prove itself a viable option, we must still find the political will to provide a reliable college scholarship option to city students. </p><p>4) College should not be the only way for our youth to be prepared for entering the job market. I will push for the creation of more internship/apprenticeship programming within City agencies, managed within the Office of Employment.</p>",
    "q7":"I don't think we need to formally change anything, but during my time in City Government, I'm seen too many instances where the council finds consensus on a issue, but for any number of reasons, political or policy based, a bill faces the threat or actual use of veto or line-item veto by the Mayor.</p><p>Many times, I believe we have let the perfect be the enemy of the good</p><p>For Example: in my opinion the initial Body Camera bill the Council passed in 2014 should have been signed immediately, and the research and implementation of best practices left to the Mayor's Office and BPD to complete as quickly as possible.</p><p>Questions regarding best practices and implementation details are the role of the Executive branch – execute the laws passed. </p><p>This delay meant lost time and potentially missing out on an opportunity to avoid the tragedy of Freddie Gray's death and the civil unrest it caused (if Body Camera's would have made a difference)</p><p>In addition, the Mayor's Office has wasted valuable time trying to \"manage\" the council and its votes on numerous issues while reducing the role of CitiStat and failing to exert enough oversight of the billions of dollars of city agency it should be laser-focused on as the executive branch.</p><p>I believe this is partly a result of our pattern of electing City Councilmen to the position of Mayor, and how tough it might for these individuals to give up control of / influence in the council.</p>",
    "q8":"I believe Public Safety and how officers and other public safety personnel treat the community is the issue that is most pressing in the minds of many citizens for this city, followed by economic development and job creation, and combating Heroin and other drug addiction. My big issue is affordable, healthy housing.</p><p>I think the council has been focused on the right issues generally, but style of its focus - often times using more political grandstanding and classic small town politics - has been to our detriment. Its difficult because the process-based critical analysis this City needs to beetter itself should be coming from CitiStat, but it has not been an honest focus of the current administration, and even when it once was, these meetings are closed to council members (and rightfully so). Because of this, I believe its been difficult for most councilmen and women to have a real understanding, process wise, of how the many city agencies work and how city services are actually provided. City Council hearings should be that venue for the council, but are in my estimation often dominated by the grandstanding and classic small town politics mentioned previously. As a council member, I will bring to bear experience and credible knowledge from my time at City Hall and with Emergency Management. I'll also pledge to maintain my love of learning and continue learning about my community, about my city, and about the City Government and what makes them both succeed and sometimes struggle.</p>",
    "q9":"While the next Mayor needs to restore CitiStat to drive results, I also believe the City needs to treat people better. I believe we've all had some less than stellar experiences with customer service dealing with the City.</p><p>If elected, I would push for a new Quality Assurance Monitoring program. When calling many other businesses, the first thing you hear is \"this call may be monitored or recorded for quality assurance\". This is important because a % of calls ARE monitored and if the customer service received isn't satisfactory, mandatory re-training and other actions (including reprimand, if needed) can be taken to ensure customer service improves</p><p>No-one calling to get assistance from the City wants to be met with an attitude, or wants to be treated with less than 100% respect and courtesy.</p><p>Everyone wants to get the service they are looking for or, at the very least, be pointed in the right direction</p><p>We must assure that, even on our worst day, every city employee remembers that we are here to serve, and the person on the other line is a well meaning taxpayer looking for service and assistance on what might be for a tough day for them, also.</p><p>It does not help that the City's phone system is a mess. I would push for an Ombudsman to work with MTE, the City Hall Operators, and the Comptroller to update and maintain the City Directory of agency land lines, so navigating city government is easy for EVERY citizen.</p>",
    "q10":"I am running because I believe in this City, and believe I have something to offer with relevant public safety experience working for the City. After the riots, I believe we need new, young, knowledgeable leaders in the Council. But we also need leaders who are willing to listen to the community and learn. I wouldn't be starting from scratch in terms of experience with and knowledge of how the City works (and sometimes fails to work). I can be a part of how we better its operations and assist our citizens in leading the best lives possible.</p>"

    "q1":"The most pressing issues in my district are public safety, jobs and education. In the area of public safety we will work to keep our communities safe through enhanced crime prevention efforts that include:</p><p>- Community-police partnerships</p><p>- Improved emergency response</p><p>- Upgraded lighting</p><p>- Strategic installation of cameras and</p><p>- Targeted code enforcement and blight removal to eliminate environments that attract illegal activity.</p><p>But crime prevention cannot be addressed by law enforcement alone, we must implement pre-booking diversion programs as an alternative for minor drug arrests, in order to connect offenders with treatment, employment and housing services.</p><p>In the area of job creation, we must:</p><p>- Provide financial incentives for businesses that locate, hire, or expand in underserved areas.</p><p>- Identify and create financial incentives to support the development of small business and entrepreneurs.</p><p>- Create development opportunities to attract investment, especially in the areas of information technology, health sciences and innovation.</p><p>- Promote and expand employment training in information technology, health and bioscience, and advanced manufacturing.</p><p>And most importantly in the area of education we must:</p><p>- Support each school in its efforts to become a Community School that promotes student achievement, positive conditions for learning, and the overall well-being of families and communities.</p><p>- Work with principals and administrators to identify financial, technical and human capital resources to improve academics, enrichment activities, health care and social supports, family engagement and youth and community development in each school.</p><p>- Expand technology-based education opportunities for youth in schools, libraries, and community-based programs.</p><p>- Expand art programs in the schools and community.</p>",
    "q2":"By emphasizing community-police partnerships and focusing on targeting the most violent offenders, I believe that Baltimore is taking the proper steps to address violence in our communities. Commissioner Davis is experienced, has a track record of results and has earned the respect and trust of the officers that serve our communities every day.</p><p>But while I believe that the enforcement of the law is a Police function, crime prevention is everyone's responsibility. So whether we work in economic development, education, health, recreation, or even the faith community all of our collective efforts have the potential to promote a safer and more vibrant community.</p><p>Many residents long for the days when you knew the officer that worked in your neighborhood and that's not just out of a sense of nostalgia. We have to reintegrate the officer as a vital resource in the community. Part of that is the strategic deployment of police cadets once they leave the academy. In many cases these officers should be utilized in our commercial corridors, transit hubs, and other areas where residents are prevented from accessing services and patronizing businesses because of drug dealing and other illegal activities. In addition we need to support and expand programs like the Police Explorers that promote positive interactions and relationships with officers and youth.</p>",
    "q3":"It goes without saying that the death of Freddie Gray was a tragedy and the subsequent protest and unrest have in a real way awakened this city and the nation to the many disparities that exist in urban centers throughout our country. No one in their right mind would have hoped for the events of last April, but there is no denying that they occurred. And because they occurred we have now been afforded the opportunity to address community and police relationships, economic inclusion, education, health and housing inequalities with a renewed commitment to identify resources, support best practices, develop initiatives, redefine our sense of community and to be intentional in our desire to elevate all Baltimoreans and all neighborhoods. What we do with this opportunity and how we reposition our city is not only critical to Baltimore but will have national ramifications.</p>",
    "q4":"Baltimore's property tax rate, which is double that of any other of the surrounding counties in the State, remains a significant impediment to the attraction of residents and businesses to the city. Identifying strategies for reducing the property tax rate must be a priority. Of course that's easier said than done, because the reduction must be done in a way that doesn't jeopardize the provision of essential city services. The tax rate must be reduced incrementally to limit the impact on the delivery of those services but also in a predictable manner so that property owners have confidence that their property taxes will be going down.</p><p>There is no quick remedy to solving the tax burden that homeowner's face in the city, outside of increasing the city's tax base. Therefore the city should be diligent in identifying job-creating, revenue-increasing development opportunities throughout the city. TIFs and PILOTs when used appropriately can be effective tools to achieve that goal. Often when discussing TIFs many are quick to paint them in a negative light, when in fact many of our neighborhoods could benefit from them. I was fortune to be the lead on the redevelopment of Mondawmin Mall in West Baltimore. If not for a $15 million TIF, that $80 million redevelopment would not have been possible. No Target (first in the city), no new supermarket (largest in the city at the time) or other retailers, and none of the hundreds of jobs that were created as a result. </p>",
    "q5":"Although challenging, there are a variety of tools the city can use to encourage development in areas away from the waterfront. There are tools like the Enterprise Zone and the Enterprise Zone Focus Area Tax Credit that can be used for commercial redevelopment. Historic Tax Credits and the Low Income Housing Tax Credit can be used for residential development. In addition TIFs have proven to be very effective as exemplified with the redevelopment of Mondawmin Mall. Having leadership, even at the Council level, that understands these tools and their application is critical to revitalizing our neighborhoods.</p><p>Identifying financial resources is only part of the equation when it comes to revitalizing neighborhoods. True neighborhood revitalization also means creating sustainable communities that are safe, affordable, and inclusive. For example city-owned vacant lots can be turned into community managed open space or community gardens. Programs that provide financial assistance to homeowners to rehab their homes should be promoted and even expanded. Resources that would allow seniors to retrofit their homes and age in place should be identified. Funding for commercial façade improvement grants should be increased. </p><p>But in many of our communities even before we can promote any of these efforts we have to manage the number of vacant properties that blight our neighborhoods. Vacants to Value offers a strategy for the targeted demolition of these nuisance properties, rehabilitation of key buildings and the creation of development clusters. The resources provided by Governor Hogan will allow those efforts to impact more neighborhoods. </p>",
    "q6":"In many communities throughout the city the chief barrier to economic development and job creation is crime. Public safety is the major impediment to creating an environment for investment and attracting businesses and firms to certain areas. In order to increase the economic vitality of our neighborhoods we must steadily and significantly reduce the crime. Some of the many strategies to achieve that goal are to promote public safety through enhanced crime prevention efforts (community-police partnerships, upgraded lighting and installation of cameras) and improved emergency response. As well as developing and implementing pre-booking diversion programs as an alternative for minor drug arrests, in order to connect offenders with treatment, employment and housing services.</p>",
    "q7":"There is no debate that Baltimore's current governance structure is heavily tilted toward the Mayor, a fact that merits more exploration. But the fact that this is the case does not mean that the City Council cannot be effective and impactful in fulfilling its role to constituents throughout the city. I would be leery of rushing into any changes of the current system.</p>",
    "q8":"I believe that it's up to each Council and each Councilmember to determine what issues are of most significance to them. As the representative for the 7th District my focus would be on economic development, job creation, maintaining safe and affordable housing, public safety and improving educational opportunities for all youth.</p>",
    "q9":"I believe that in any business or agency whether they be private or public there is always opportunity for improvement. So it is important that each city service be evaluated to make certain that residents are receiving the highest quality of service and that incentives be created for exemplary service.</p>",
    "q10":"I have been blessed to work in local city government for the past 20 years. In 1996 I started as a Council Assistant in Councilman Keiffer Mitchell's Office. It was there where I first discovered my passion for public service. Eventually serving as his chief of staff, I transitioned to the Baltimore Development Corporation in 2005, where I served as a Senior Development Officer for West Baltimore. While there I was the project manager for over $700 million dollars of development including the redevelopment of Mondawmin Mall and the Horseshoe Casino. I was directly involved in the opening of eight supermarkets in food deserts throughout the city. In 2014 I accepted a position on the Mayor's staff, where I currently serve as the Assistant Deputy Mayor for Economic and Neighborhood Development. At each stop I have always been and remain committed to helping to improve communities throughout the city.</p><p>The civil unrest of last April has done nothing but strengthen my resolve to serve. The challenges that we face are diverse and this is truly a critical time in the life of our city, but I believe that over the past 20 years I have exemplified the commitment, the passion and the insight necessary to affect positive change in the 7th District.</p>"

There are areas in the 7th district are labled \"hot spots\". However, the citizens don't know that they live in a area that holds such a label. The constitutional rights which are afforded to more affluent neighborhoods in this city are non exsistent in the 7th. There must be more community policing .

We must Improve the retail and housing and people will come and crime will drop. The program vacants to value has good intentions but has been slow going.

    "q1":"I am running for office because I grew up, reside, and worship in West Baltimore. As a child I witnessed gun violence, people living in poverty, and the lack of opportunities in the communities that I grew up in and around. Unfortunately, more than 20 years later as an adult, I am still witnessing the same issues, but now, I am able to do something about it. I am able to connect with the youth, give a voice to those who are voiceless, and restore pride to my community that the elderly can be proud of again. West Baltimore is a beautiful place but there is some dust on it, as Councilman, I will brush the dust off and get to work as the bridge between Sandtown and City Hall, the bridge between Druid Park and City Hall, the bridge between Hampden and City Hall. I am simply tired of failed policies that do not focus on building relationships in the community to confront real-world issues such as: food desserts, job creation and economic development, affordable housing opportunities, safe communities, reduction of incarceration and violence rates, combating drug addiction. I see the possibility of the 7th District because the people who live in the community are some of the best people that you will find, they are working every day to move their communities forward and they are tired of failed promises and want someone that will be a part of the community and someone they can relate to and trust. The list of negatives from others can trail on yet I see beauty in the 7th District and that is why I am Fighting Downtown for A Better Uptown!</p>",
    "q2":"1- Safe communities- I plan to address this issue by: 1- looking at gun violence and accessing the City's data which will allow us to make better informed decisions about the way we target violent offenders. 2- Reach the youth and work on violence prevention as well as provide job readiness and training programs that offer other opportunities for the youth. 3- Change the relationship between the police and the community to make it one of mutual respect and one that thrives on the relationships that are formed opposed to the authority. 2- Job training and development- I will work require all developers to sign PMA's that will require them offer jobs to members of the community, in addition, I will partner with small and large businesses so that I can learn exactly what skills are needed that the residents can learn and work to offer those skills in job training and job readiness centers. Furthermore, I will insist that we hold job training facilities accountable to the people who enroll in their programs so that we can insure that any person who goes to a job readiness program is equipped to work and can find a job that can be a career opportunity. 3- Transportation- In West Baltimore we do not have a reliable means of transportation. I will work to implement a transportation system that allows the residents to get to and from work quickly, safely, and effectively.</p>",
    "q3":"The lessons I have drawn from the death of Freddie Gray and the subsequent protests and unrest are: 1- Freddie Gray was a human being but he was not treated as such and that in itself is a grave injustice. 2- We cannot judge the many for the actions of the few- I saw the beauty of individuals coming together to not only demand justice for Freddie Gray but to evolve into a new era in Baltimore. 3- Hate begets more hate- the opposite is also true, love begets more love so when work in the spirit of brotherly love we are able to not only protest but to create transformation. 4- The protests and unrest had an underlying effect; the untimely death of Freddie Gray ignited many of the issues that residents of Baltimore have faced: generational and systematic poverty, police brutality and lack of positive relationships between the community and the police, lack of government accountability and transparency- we have to hold our elected officials accountable to the community as well as to addressing not only these issues but so many others that have gone unresolved for decades. 4- Change and unity are possible- the great news is that we have the power to elect leaders that are committed to unity, accountability, social justice, and providing the opportunity for every person to have an opportunity to succeed.</p>",
    "q4":"Baltimore should reduce it's property tax rate, currently, Baltimore has one of the highest property tax rates in Maryland. To reduce the property tax rate, we have to use the additional income that Baltimore has earned as a result of increased property values. In many areas of the City, property values have increased and therefore the amount of revenue that the City has earned is higher which offers the opportunity for using the added income to reduce the property taxes. I do not agree with the use of tax increment financing in lieu of taxes and other incentives to encourage developers; I would overall work to reduce commercial property taxes but tax increment financing(TIF) does not overall benefit the City. When the City engages in a TIF agreement, the benefits are for the developer. If it is not explicitly stated that the developer will hire people from the community, work with job readiness programs to insure that qualified applicants are being given competitive jobs, as well as insuring that the developer will be a benefit to the community then a TIF should not be used because in the end the City could be left with the bill that the developer would have traditionally paid such as those used for roads. In the event that a TIF is used it must be combined with an agreement that will serve the community; the TIF cannot stand alone to offer incentives to the developer without the developer offering tangible rewards to the citizens.</p>",
    "q5":"In order to encourage commercial and residential revitalization of neighborhoods we have to take a multi-dimensional approach. At FEMINC I have changed blight by taken abandoned buildings and created a resource center for the community; changing blight is a community effort. We cannot do as Governor Hogan has done, and say, we will invest to tear down properties yet we have not worked with residents and activists that have lived in Baltimore. In order to revitalize commercial and residential neighborhoods, the same amount of disinvestment that has went into our communities have to now be changed to reinvest. Many ask me, what would I have done with the money that the Governor is proposing to \"redevelop\" Baltimore- I can clearly answer- the money would have went to job training programs, developing green spaces so that in West Baltimore we can have parks, fresh food gardens and markets, and provide grants to those organizations and community associations that have already been doing the work of advocating for West Baltimore communities. The Vacants to Value program has not been successful in my opinion; the intended mission of the program was to redevelop blighted areas. Unfortunately, I have not seen this happen in West Baltimore where we still have many vacant homes. In addition, many developers have began redevelopment and ended the projects early, many individuals are unable to receive financing to purchase the homes, and once areas are redeveloped the homes are selling for $300,000 which is an open door for gentrification.</p>",
    "q6":"The chief barrier to economic development and job creation in Baltimore is there is a disconnect between employers and potential employees. In order to bridge this divide we have not only invest in small businesses that traditionally hire locally, we also have to work with larger companies to insure that anyone who wants a job in Baltimore is trained for the job they want. We have to build a bridge between employers and trade schools to be sure that the job training that we offer is in demand in the job market. In addition, we have to look at those citizens who have not been a part of the job market traditionally and get them to work; the individuals who have been unable to find employment based on educational barriers or background barriers- these individuals have to be included in the job market. Essentially, Baltimore has a diverse economy with the potential to offer every citizen who wants a job the opportunity to work and that starts by working with small business owners, large business, vocational and trade schools to create partnership that benefits residents in the 7th District and throughout Baltimore.</p>",
    "q7":"The current balance between the mayor and City Council is not appropriate; currently the City Council needs more votes than the Congress and the General Assembly to overrides vetoes issued by the Mayor. The Mayor has recently vetoed several of the City Council bills. I would agree with the amendments that the current City Council is proposing to reduce the power of the Mayor such as: reducing the amount of votes necessary to override a veto as well as reducing the size of the Board of Estimates. Currently, members serving on the Board of Estimates report to the Mayor; this is an unfair practice and still gives the Mayor control of the Board- those who serve on the Board should be separately elected. The balance of power between the Mayor and City Council should be able to provide the opportunity to be checked on both sides of the spectrum. The City Council has to have the power to affect change in the Districts that they represent which will be better for not only individual Districts but for the entire City.</p>",
    "q8":"The most important issue the City Council has dealt with in the last four years include: 1- the current debate to provide funding to the youth of Baltimore that will expand youth services, 2- \"Ban the Box\" bill which allowed ex-offenders assistance with finding jobs, and 3- implementing body cameras for all police officers to assist with police accountability. While the Council has tackled some issues, there are many issues that still need to be resolved. These include developing real plans for changing blight in our communities that redevelop communities without displacing members of the community, plans that include funds for job training to reduce the likelihood of crimes taking place as well as reduce recidivism for ex-offenders, as well as plans that combat issues of the lack of access to quality food and efficient transportation. In fact, we have to move beyond plans to implementation that partners with the community instead of developing bills and then presenting them to the community. City Council members if they do not already need to have offices located in their Districts where residents can easily access them and the Council member is seen as a servant and a part of the community. In order to fully keep a pulse the issues that are taking place in the community as Councilman I would continue to be fully engaged and a part of the community and this will be the way to keep my focus on the right issues.</p>",
    "q9":"The weaknesses that I see in the delivery of city services is that in areas like the 7th District, city services are received last. For instance, as I have been knocking on doors and speaking to residents in the City I have heard numerous complaints regarding the timeliness of trash or snow removal. In addition, it is apparent that certain areas of the City receive services at a much more efficient rate than other areas. During our last snow storm you could easily go downtown and surrounding areas while areas in the 7th District were not shoveled at all. In order to improve response time and resident satisfaction the city has to work with residents in order to make their priorities a part of the plans that the city uses when developing the plans to deliver city services. When residents are a part of the planning and implementation process then we can improve resident satisfaction.</p>",
    "q10":"None- I am not a politician; the beauty of my candidacy is that I do not have political experience. As a Pastor, I know what it takes to empower not only our young people but to close the generational lines that divide us so that we may build strong communities. I have been an avid community leader and activist during the Freddie Gray protests but before that as well through: coaching young men's basketball teams, transforming blight in the community, as well as, standing up for social injustices.</p>"

    "q1":"Unemployment is the most pressing issue in the district., As Father Greg of Homeboy Industries said, \"only a job can stop a bullet\". The distress and crime rate in the 8th can be lowered with proper attention to creating more jobs. We can create more opportunities by forging partnerships woith unions that represent carpenters, plumbers, electricians, welders, etc. and train and mentor candidates through their apprenticeships ensuring full employment at a significant wage.</p><p>The crime rate in the eighth can be addressed at the same time time with laser like attention on repeat offenders who are not willing or able to go to work. The drug trade is emblematic of a failed public policy that makes criminals of many men who are earning money for their families.We must find other avenues for them to find work and start to learn a work ethic that will allow them to work for the rest of their lives. </p><p>We must also help them rediscover the hope that they once had so they can see a future themselves. This can only be done when they are able to work and feed themselves and their children.</p>",
    "q2":"Crime is a significant factor in not only the communities because of the the drug trade but because citizens believe that it is victimless. But it ravages communities. </p><p>The police department must focus on the worst criminals; we have heard this strategy bandies about in the city for some time. It must be vigorously implemented. This can only be done if citizens feel that their concerns are addressed.</p><p>I would establish a dedicated line and track the calls and responses of the police department to the concerts of my constituents. Although they use citistat; it can only be tracked if the complaints or concerns or reports of criminal activity are actually recorded. This would allow us to have accountability for the actions and reactions to the calls of the citizens of the eighth district. It would also allow me to have actual facts to report or question the response of the police in our district. </p><p>We couild then have community meetings to discuss the responsiveness of the police, the issues that are continue to plague the community. This will enable a discourse to happen that is not happening now. There is a lot of finger pointing and recriminations that are going on for both sides. This will help create trust and a fruitful dialogue between the community and the police department.</p>",
    "q3":"I believe that the death of Freddie Gray was unfortunate and should never have happened if the protocols of the police department had been followed as outlined in the general orders.</p><p>The looting of the drug stores and businesses was attributable to a small proportionate criminal element that was taking advantage of the unrest.</p><p>The unrest in and of itself was a symptom of the underlying anger and disenfranchisement that has been felt in the black community for a significantly long time.</p><p>The black community has felt ignored, irrelevant and powerless to change its circumstances in the city. The black community has a high unemployment rate, high crime rate, and a feeling that no one is listening.</p><p>The response to the unrest has been underwhelming. Everyone wants to pour money in the neighborhoods through the same conduits that got us to the riots. The same people will be making the decisions about what will happen in the neighborhoods. In ten years those same people will remain and we will be back where we are today.</p><p>The people from the community who were interviewed after the riots were talking about jobs, getting to work and providing for their families. </p><p>A year later the lessons have not been learned. The communities are happy that the pharmacies are coming back on line, that there is a stronger police presence and policing strategy is focused.</p><p>But it has not resulted in a reduction in the unemployment rate. We still have not heard the voices.</p>",
    "q4":"I don't believe that the property tax rate is a significant hindrance. People still want to live in the city and be close to the activities that are offered. However, most of the people that taking advantage of the amenities are young and single. We lose most of population because they do not view the city as a place to raise a family. That means that we must focus our efforts on improving the school system.</p><p>I believe that TIF's should only be used when a developer has a project with significant public interest and that the project has an overwhelming benefit to the community and or the city. TIF's should not be used for projects that are generally profitable and would only be used to increase the margins. I would define significant public interest a, but not limited to a low income or mixed income housing project that would not move forward without public funds, a development that is in a part of Baltimore that has seen significant disinvestment.</p><p>TIF's should be used when a project will not be developed but for the public investment.</p>",
    "q5":"In the eighth district which should be considered a gateway to the city there is a compelling interest to move projects like Uplands forward as fast as possible. The development of a business incubator on the west side along Edmondson Avenue to help spur development. A gateway development at Edmondson and Franklin especially with the abadonment of the red line. A number of small developers already have investments in these areas. It would be a great time to tap in to these resources and develop a long term plan for the development of Edmondson (rte 40) that would get people to stop and get something as simple as a cup of coffee.</p><p>Vacants to value and the governor's proposed demolition plan will go a long way to help alleviate the view that we are dilapidated, poor and old metropolitan city. </p>",
    "q6":"The single most important barrier to job creation is the inability of our school system to properly educate our children. The basics of education are reading and math. You cannot write code for a computer, repair a car, or be a carpenter .if you cannot read or do simple math.</p><p>I believe that we have ensure that they are educated properly.</p><p>Absent the faith in our school system at this time we must forge alliances with business and unions to foster training programs that will allow are citizens to apply and keep entry level positions with a promising outlook for the future. This means getting teller positions at banks, apprenticeship programs in the trades, learning to operate heavy euipment or learning how to weld. There are many trades that you can learn and do without a college degree. In most cases you can earn more than you would with a college degree.</p><p>We can teach and train our teenagers that there is a compelling reason to stay in school even if you do not go to college. There are many opportunities for you in the job market.</p>",
    "q7":"I believe the balance of power is fine. The Bolton change that I woulkd like to see would be the Board of Estimates. I would like to see that reduced to three members; Mayor, Comptroller and City Council President.</p>",
    "q8":"I believe the city council has passed or considered a lot of \"feel good legislation\". Ban the box, dirt bike park, etc are all reactionary and really do not change anything.</p><p>The ban the box although a good idea on it face does not change the fact that public records still go back beyond seven years for a background check. I can see what you did twenty years ago and not hire you regardless of your conduct since the incident..</p><p>The Transform Baltimore-rezoning effort although not passed yet will make a significant difference for small businesses and neighborhoods moving forward.</p><p>I would like to see legislation that limits the time a business can research a potential applicants background and criminal history with the exception of violence or theft.</p><p>I would like to city the city councils sponsor, pass and work to pass legislation to change the board of estimates, change the school board to an elected school board and limit the board of estimates to elected officials only.</p>",
    "q9":"The most significant issue is response to issues that citizens. The 311 operators must have more information especially during emergencies i.e. snow storms, flooding etc. They should be given access or have information on when streets are plowed, streets will be cleared etc.</p>",
    "q10":"I am running for city council because I believe there should be a stronger focus on training and job creation to help alleviate the significantly high unemployment rate among men between the ages of 19 and 30.</p>"

    "q1":"After years of working alongside several neighborhood improvement associations and personally visiting over 6,000 homes throughout every neighborhood in the 8th District, I have gained a deep understanding of the issues impacting residents. The most pressing issues that residents have shared with me along this journey are a need for greater access to employment opportunities that pay family-supporting wages, enriching afterschool programing for our youth, and an end to the violence that has devastated families and communities throughout our City. </p><p>To address the issue of un-and underemployment, I believe we must leverage funding to support businesses and initiatives that prioritize the training and hiring of hard to employ area residents, such as adults without a GED or HS equivalent, a criminal record, and little if any work experience. I will work with labor unions and community-based workforce development programs, making sure that they prioritize recruitment of and service to residents in our neighborhoods. </p><p>Additionally, I will engage citywide stakeholders to ensure our residents have access to entrepreneurship training and mentorship opportunities, start-up capital, and other resources to help them successfully launch and sustain more community-rooted and community-owned enterprises.</p><p>To empower our youth, I would work to provide resources for community-based afterschool initiatives that attract and engage them in fun, technology-centered, academically enriching activities. Also, I believe that putting an end to the violence that is devastating our neighborhoods and ensure our youth live productive and fulfilling lives, we must support community-based mediation and mentorship initiatives and fully fund youth-job programs. </p>",
    "q2":"Recently developed programs that have been implemented by the Baltimore City Heath and Police Departments, which utilize community-building strategies to reduce violence in our neighborhoods are a step in the right direction. I believe that efforts to engage directly with our youth and work to empower community leaders to be change agents are most effective in transforming our neighborhoods. </p><p>Though, I would advocate for increased financial support for the capacity building of community-led and managed organizations; as they've been proven to be more sustainable over time and more likely to build trust in neighborhoods where relationships between law enforcement and residents are deeply strained. </p><p>Additionally, I believe that we must begin to view gun violence as a public health crisis and address the underlying issues that lead to violence—which cannot be resolved by the criminal justice system's overreliance on mass incarceration. Rather, it requires a commitment to treating drug addiction, mental health interventions, and reinvesting in public housing to eliminate the disturbing prevalence of lead poisoning among Black youth.</p><p>To improve police-community relations, I believe it's crucial that significant policy changes be implemented to hold bad law enforcement officers accountable for their actions. Recent efforts to implement community-policing strategies by the Baltimore City Police Department will only be affective if communities and law enforcement officers can develop constructive relationships rooted in trust, transparency, and mutual accountability. Additionally, I support the establishment of partnerships with community-based organizations to implement officer re-training focused on the use of de-escalation techniques and mediation. </p>",
    "q3":"The death of Freddie Gray and the unrest that followed brought to the forefront the fractured relationship between communities of color and law enforcement in Baltimore City. Furthermore, this was compounded by deep frustration with the historic disinvestment and neglect of low-income neighborhoods, schools, and housing in the very communities that need it most. </p><p>What became evident after reflecting on what occurred was the need to address the socioeconomic disparities that exist between what many consider the \"Two Baltimore's\". One is flush with economic opportunity and where public investment is bountiful and the other economically deprived for generations. Tragically, the boundaries of these \"Two Baltimore's\" were drawn on redlining maps during the era of Jim Crow and have persisted since. </p><p>But, out of the tragedy that occurred last April, has come a renewed since of urgency to have honest dialogues about the structural inequities that exist and to push our public officials to make real changes to address issues of inadequate housing, underfunded classrooms, a lack of living wage jobs, and an end to mass incarceration. While tensions between residents and law enforcement were the clear symptoms of the problem, it's going to take a lot more than the police department to deal with the actual causes of the problem. I look forward to working alongside neighborhood residents, community advocates, and other public officials on the front lines to address these issues. </p>",
    "q4":"As a homeowner in West Baltimore, I would certainly appreciate a tax reduction but given the current state of the city and the needs of our communities, I would not support a reduction of the property tax rate at this time. I expect the city to be fiscally responsible and transparent in how it uses those tax revenues, which is where there is a missed opportunity with audits. Many homeowners have shared with me deep frustration with the lack of transparency on how the taxes are being spent. </p><p>Nearly fifty percent of the city's general fund revenue is generated by property taxes and significant cuts would likely result in a negative impact on city services. I believe that work needs to be done to grow our tax base, which starts with making our neighborhoods stronger and safer, eliminating blight, and improving our public schools—all of which will draw families back into the city and encourage renters to seek a pathway to homeownership. </p><p>I believe that the frequent use of tax subsidies to fund development projects has been problematic for Baltimore City. Many of these deals have gone through without seeing if public funds were really supporting public benefit. Just this year Baltimore City Public Schools received a severe cut to funding from the State due to an increase in citywide property value assessments. This deeply impacts our ability to adequately educate our youth and provide them with the resources they need to succeed—jeopardizing the future of our city. </p>",
    "q5":"I would support implementing a vacant property tax to discourage speculation by investors and to encourage and incentivize homeownership. There are an estimated 30,000 vacant properties throughout Baltimore City, of which, the vast majority are privately owned and severely neglected. Owners don't pay their fair share of property taxes due to having lower assessments than homeowners who do invest in the upkeep of their homes. </p><p>Also, I would advocate for and assist in the development of community land trusts to transform vacant properties into better community use—more recreational-use, greenspace, and community-controlled affordable housing. Additionally, CLTs provide an opportunity to create employment opportunities for local residents who can be trained to demolish and/or renovate blighted properties. </p><p>Additionally, I believe that we must begin to prioritize the use of transit-oriented development to encourage the revitalizing of commercial corridors that are away from the waterfront. Targeted redevelopment incentives for these areas will provide resources to small businesses to modernize their properties and grow their customer base by encouraging commuters along major roadways and public-transit routes to patronize their stores and thus grow the local economy. </p><p>Regarding the Vacants-to-Value initiative and the Governors recently announced increase in funding available for demolition and incentives for new housing development, I believe more can and should be done to engage city residents in the planning and implementation process. Both programs have serious barriers to entry for city residents to have a seat at the table and share their vision in the redevelopment of their own neighborhoods. </p>",
    "q6":"Baltimore City has long been impacted by a lack of economic opportunity, fueled not only by global trends out of our control and by poor policy decisions locally, but also, by a growing skills gap between what is required to fill job opportunities in emerging high skill and high wage fields. Areas like construction, health care and technology development are areas that we need to focus on closing this gap. </p><p>I firmly believe the only way forward is to increase investment in labor and community-based apprenticeship programs, community college, adult education programs, and workforce development/readiness organizations. Additionally, more support is needed for organizations that assist returning-citizens with skills development and criminal record expungement. </p><p>Though, it doesn't matter how many jobs you create if city residents can't get to them. Too many of our neighborhoods lack strong transit choices that can connect our transit-dependent households, and attract neighborhood investment. My vision for transportation in Baltimore is to push for a system that reduces the time it takes for residents to get to work and school and which connects regionally to expand access to well-paying employment opportunities across the region. </p><p>Finally, both national and local data and research overwhelmingly show us that the majority of job opportunities come from small and mid-size businesses. But many have challenges thriving due to our lack of small-business incubation and have difficulty navigating the regulations necessary to get started. </p>",
    "q7":"I believe that the City Council has a tremendous amount of power to counterbalance the influence of the Mayor's office, but has not always leveraged it in an impactful way. Though, I would still support changes in the balance of power between the City Council and the Mayor in a few key areas. </p><p>Currently, the City Council does not have enough power over the funding priorities within the city budget. The Council may reduce or eliminate budget request but cannot increase funding or add new requests. I would support allowing the Council to reallocate funding within the budget, so that the priorities of the council are reflected and advocated for. </p><p>Also, I would support reintroducing a charter amendment to strengthen the Councils veto power by allowing a two-thirds vote to override a mayoral veto. </p>",
    "q8":"I believe that there are areas that the City Council could have certainly focused more attention to make a bigger impact on our city. Our city still struggles with hiring local workers, paying livable wages on development projects, adequately addressing the issue of blight, and on eradicating the systemic inequities that contribute to violence. Also, not nearly enough has been done to address the issue of affordable housing. Too many families must balance the burden of paying for housing and affording necessities such as food, transportation, and medical care. </p><p>Though, over the last four years, I do believe the City Council has made some important changes on critical issues but could have certainly done more to make an impact. In my opinion, significant progress was made to:</p><p>- Reduce barriers for returning citizens seeking employment via legislation to \"ban the box\" on job applications. </p><p>- Despite a Mayoral veto, the council's vote for police body cameras was a step in the right direction to build trust between Baltimore Police and community residents. </p><p>- Many have stressed the need for more transparency and accountability regarding the way the city spends tax dollars, and in 2012 the City Council passed a bill to allow voters to amend the charter and require 13 city agencies to be audited every four years. </p>",
    "q9":"I believe the city could improve service by relying more on the use of open data and being transparent and accountable about city services, in order to accurately diagnose where there are challenge. The city needs to involve citizens in being a part of the solution. I have had countless discussions with residents in the 8th District about the areas of improvement they'd like to see in order to make their neighborhood stronger. </p><p>In my conversations with residents, many have expressed ideas on issues including trash, illegal dumping, vacant property maintenance, and holding landlords accountable for not maintaining their property. Many have shared ideas on how to resolve these issues but have expressed frustration with the lack of opportunity to give their feedback and input. It is important that we implement a variety of strategies to directly engage with and seek feedback from city residents on how to best meet their needs. </p><p>To improve quality and responsiveness of city services, I would advocate for an increased reliance on data to guide the allocation and ensure the efficient use of resources to address the issues in our city. There is truly a need to utilize technology to increase public engagement in service improvement and to promote transparency in how our resources are being allocated. Additionally, it is crucial to eliminate departmental silos and encourage collaboration between agencies and with the public to improve services. </p>",
    "q10":"I'm running because I firmly believe our city needs a public servant will work with them. Someone with extensive experience in working to empower residents to become the change agents needed to move our city forward. As a native Baltimorean, I have made a lifelong commitment to community organizing, fighting for good jobs that pay livable wages, and engaging with and advocating for the improvement of our neighborhoods. As one of the co-founders of Neighbors Without Borders of Greater Southwest Baltimore and the Village Farmers' Market at Edmondson-Westside High School, I have a strong track record of working with my neighbors in the 8th District and connecting them to opportunities and resources.</p>"

    "q1":"Access to Stable Employment Opportunities: I will address this issue by fighting to expand access to and funding for vocational training, adult education, and re­-entry programs for members of our community seeking to jumpstart or refocus their careers. </p><p>Under-Served and Under-Resourced Public Schools: I intend to use my platform as a member of the Council to fight for: (i) the completion of in-depth financial and performance audits of the Baltimore City Public School System, (ii) the elimination of budget redundancies and wasteful and inefficient spending practices and (iii) the reallocation of wasted and misappropriated funds to fill all current teacher vacancies and increased investment in the fund for capital improvements. </p><p>Crime and Public Safety: The unfortunate levels of violence in and crime in areas of our district are symptomatic of the deep and complex issues facing some our most vulnerable communities. The best strategy for assuring that our neighborhoods are safe and welcoming environments is to work to implement and enforce policies that address the root causes underlying the troubling crime trends. I believe that begins with making proactive investments in the right things. To highlight a few: promoting and providing adequate funding for education and recreation centers, prioritizing neighborhood blight elimination, institutionalizing effective community policing strategies, supporting and expanding the community schools program, and funding empowering effective community leaders.</p>",
    "q2":"With regard t our policing strategies, I believe that Baltimore can do much better. I have confidence in the people and the communities of this City. In terms of concrete steps towards improving the police-community relations in the City, I support implementation of all the proposals put forth by the Maryland Task Force on Police Reform. I see the the twenty-two reform proposals as solid step in the correct direction. I am especially supportive of two of the task force proposals: (1) the proposal to strike down the state law preventing regular citizens from serving on the police trial boards responsible for investigating alleged police misconduct and (2) the proposal to establish new whistle-blower protections for officers willing to voice objections to colleagues' misconduct. </p><p>Furthermore, I believe that police officers should be trained in community policing techniques, including de-escalation. Because I believe that \"community\" is the operative term in the concept of community policing, I will seek to ensure that community leaders from each of City's nine police districts are involved in designing and teaching the curriculum to new and veteran officers alike. Community policing goes far beyond teaching police de-escalation tactics. I believe it is about empowering our communities to police and protect themselves. Police officers are an important part of that process, but our community leaders (those who know and understand their neighbors) must be given the resources, autonomy and appropriate deference they need to lead the way.</p>",
    "q3":"The death of Freddie Gray and the subsequent uprising put on display for the world the fact that in Baltimore, there exists a massive and unacceptable gulf between the government and the governed. We can do better. For me, the death of Freddie Gray and the subsequent cry for help from the surrounding communities brought to light more questions than answers. Questions like: Why in Baltimore City are we spending nearly the most on education in the state and getting the least--in terms of return on investment--for our students? Why are 344 Baltimoreans being senselessly murdered in the streets over the course of just one-year? And, why are our schools and recreation centers across the City being shut down at a time when we need them most? </p><p>We can do better and we must. </p><p>We need responsive leadership and the institutional mechanisms necessary to hold them directly accountable for their policies. We need strong and interwoven communities banding together to support and take ownership of our schools and the children they serve. And we need visionary leaders, prepared to make the right investments to help create the best version of our great City.</p>",
    "q4":"Yes, I believe Baltimore should reduce its property tax rate to a rate more competitive with our regional neighbors. I believe we can achieve this by charging separately for residential solid waste disposal, reducing the amount spent on parking enforcement and optimizing the efficiency of our emergency and 311 call centers. </p><p>I appreciate the role tax increment financing and other economic incentives play in attracting new investment to the City. I am, however, disappointed by the persistent imbalance in investment, both geographically and categorically. City Hall has placed a disproportionate emphasis upon encouraging development downtown and around the Harbor while ignoring areas of West Baltimore in desperate need of revitalization and development. We need leadership prepared to make balanced and focused investments that benefit a larger swath of the Baltimore community. </p><p>Furthermore, I am in favor of a deliberate push to leverage tax increment financing provided by the City to extract contributions from developers to fund recreation centers and vocational training centers across the City of Baltimore. If the City government is going to invest in businesses in the form of tax increment financing, those same businesses have an obligation to invest in the people of Baltimore</p>",
    "q5":"The City has a responsibility to act with urgency to combat our persistent and growing issue with vacant properties. The blocks upon blocks of abandoned and dilapidated buildings across the City infect the collective psyche of the citizens living in our most vulnerable neighborhoods. Equally as perverse, the vacant buildings create conditions that discourage the kind of new, private investment necessary to revitalize these blocks and communities. </p><p>The Vacants to Value program has helped the City realize a nearly 35% drop in vacant properties since late 2010. In that time, the City has demolished over 1,600 blighted properties and renovated more than 2,400. That represents real progress, but there's much more work to do. I believe the City must start by aggressively targeting and penalizing property owners who leave their buildings in disrepair. We should monitor derelict properties and their absentee owners with the same vigor with which we target street criminals. Additionally, the City should place significant focus on continuing to develop and promote subsidy programs aimed at encouraging and actively facilitating new investments in currently vacant properties. Such subsidy programs should be based upon a comprehensive redevelopment program for the City. A patchwork approach will not do. It's my opinion that no building should be demolished until there is a detailed and sustainable plan for how the resulting space will be leveraged to improve the surrounding community.</p>",
    "q6":"I think the chief barrier to economic development and job creation in Baltimore is the lack of a well-equipped and well-trained workforce. If we are committed to bringing sustainable and well-paying jobs to Baltimore, we must invest immediately in training our students and adults to compete in the 21st century global economy. That means investing dollars in education, training and job placement. The results we want for tomorrow require smart investments today.</p>",
    "q7":"I would like to see the City Council play a more active role in the annual budget process. As it is, the City Charter allows the City Council to conduct public hearings on the Ordinance of Estimates and reduce or eliminate budget items, but not to increase or add new items. I would like to see the Charter amended to allow the Council to make a limited number of recommendations for additions to the Ordinance of Estimates.</p>",
    "q8":"I believe that for the most part, the City Council has been focused on the right issues. But there is more that can and should be done with regard to those issues. </p><p>In my opinion, one of the most important issues the Council has dealt with over the past four years is the Baltimore City Youth Fund Charter Amendment.</p>",
    "q9":"I am especially concerned with how the Department of Public Works has been handling residential water accounts for households behind on payments. I believe that the City should view access to water as a basic human right to be enjoyed by all Baltimoreans. For that reason, I cannot support any plan that treats the shutting off of individual water accounts as par for the course. Between 2013 and 2015 the Board of Estimates increased water and sewer bills by approximately 37%. For the thousands of City residents who already live on severely limited monthly income, these kind of cost-of-living increases have a real and immediate impact. We have a duty to remember and protect our most vulnerable citizens. In this instance that means implementing fair and standardized payment plan programs that allow individuals behind on their water account payments to structure affordable and realistic payment plans with the City before their accounts are turned over to tax sale. Furthermore, the Department of Public Works continues to struggle with issues related to billing inconsistencies and errors. These issues often lead to residents having their water shut off in error. I would support a moratorium on water account shut-offs and tax sales until these system failures are analyzed and corrected on a Citywide basis.</p>",
    "q10":"I am running to transform the way the people of the 8th District relate with council representative. From developing innovative constituent service delivery models, to spending time driving around the district and engaging members of community, I am determined to uncover creative ways to return the power of the Council seat to the people of the 8th district. I am a believer in community-based leadership and I appreciate and respect the unique power of the ideas and energy coming out of the neighborhoods that comprise the 8th District--from Allendale to Forest Park. I will bring vision, laser-­like focus and energy to the job. I will push hard for increased accountability in City government, balanced and responsible investment in the City's future and policies throughout City government that reflect a commitment to empowering and serving the best interest of all of the people of the 8th District.</p>"

    "q1":"I live in the 8th District and as in most areas of Baltimore City, there are several issues citywide: there is a lack of business and community investment and development in several under served communities, there is an overabundance of deteriorated homes with absentee landlords, there is uptick in crime, failing educational system and city services are substandard. I would first ensure that I was an active member on several critical city council committees to include community development, education and public works. I would also seek annual city wide departmental audits to promote efficiency and fiscal accountability, I would ensure that there was greater inclusion by way of ongoing community/government input sessions prior to council votes on issues by way of social media, news letters and PSA's. I would also actively seek partnerships with businesses, philanthropic and grant writing entities to aid in community and business development, specifically to heavily invest in job development. I would move to amend the charter to resume oversight of our local educational system as well as seek to restructure our transportation system and lastly, to ensure that we are getting a fresh approach to bettering Baltimore, I would move to amend the city charter for a two term limit max. The position is one to build a better Baltimore, not build a career.</p>",
    "q2":"Baltimore's violent crime issues are based on generational administrative neglect. I believe that there have been some steps toward progress, but we are still off the mark. Community Schools and the revamp of the Mayor's Office of Economic Employment and Development have opened the door to addressing some of the factors, but mental health is a critical piece that has not received the amount of attention desperately needed. Many children suffer anguish, familial dysfunctionalism, abuse, neglect and biological and environmental deficits that adversely affect their overall development. As they grow into adulthood, they bring with them that unaddressed baggage. We seem to forget that at one point, the adult violent and repeat violent offenders were once children. At what point did they lose their innocence? I beleive the police are beginning to move in the right direction with better community based models of approach, but there is still more work to do with greater investment such as the reinstitution of the PAL Centers as part of their crime fighting budget, an increase of officers living in the community, greater promotion from within and implementation of community mediation. We must seek wrap around support services for re-entering ex-offenders with a history of violence. Education and Employment are key starting points, but ultimately, there must be a trifecta partnership of community, law enforcement and local government all collaboratively committed to reduction through re-investment and re-directing resources into prevention and not just reaction. By the time we arrest, its already too late.</p>",
    "q3":"I am troubled that we have experienced the Freddie Gray's for years and but for social media and camera phones, the opportunity to more thoroughly address disparity would not have come to fruition as expeditiously as it has. The real lessons are that we cannot expect to progress when we continue to leave so many behind in under-invested, under-developed and underserved communities. As a result, we have many children who have been exposed to environmental as well as biological conditions that have robbed them of opportunity to develop healthy and whole, thus becoming frustrated, angered and overwhelmed with feelings of hopelessness. Basically, ticking time bombs waiting to go off. We are truly fighting more than just crime, we are fighting hopelessness. We are reminded of the strain and disconnect in police and community relations, institutional racism and understated sense of citizens feeling there has not been any real justice for them. We have to move in a direction of inclusion and empowerment, understanding that it benefits us all. This is not just a their problem, this is our problem and we are to be measured by how well we help the least of thee. Not in handouts, but helping people help themselves and creating opportunities for success.</p>",
    "q4":"We should reduce residential property taxes by establishing a set percentage commensurate with the average home value, looking at local and national standards. With greater oversight, responsible spending and audits of the fiscal purse strings, a tax rate reduction should afford continued support of city services. My view of the city's use of TIF's, payments in lieu and other incentives are great concepts if actually manage properly and enforced along with both immediate and long term benefits to the community directly affected and the city as a whole. We need West Baltimore Community Development projects. Incentives that would offer no taxes, deferred or otherwise are only good if we can acquire immediate, intermediate and long term benefits. There must be an equitable trade off if we are to lose out on an increase in tax based revenue or substantially reduced lump sum or even protracted payment plan less than the value of overall gain. This will require setting a standard and creating an oversight committee to ensure that the city gets the benefit of the bargain and no longer favored contracts awarded without full vetting and public approval of the prospective projects. This is where greater transparency will prove valuable.</p>",
    "q5":"First, revitalization can commence from within. I have actually thought and formulated a concept of the City partnering with developers and banks to create its own community development/mortgage program. The City could identify structurally and environmentally sound vacants. They would partner with developers to train locals and perform the work of restoration and rehabilitation. The City would then create it's own mortgage arm (requiring the training and hiring of persons to perform collection and processing functions) Simply, the city and the developers would leverage investment dollars and sweat equity for specific development and training projects thereby promoting job creation, affordable housing and a new market of an expanded tax base. This of course would be incentified to include reduced pricing for participating developers for separate investment projects, tax write offs as well as potential labor force (apprenticeship participants receiving a stipend under the City's established budget) By developing affordable housing and partnering with major businesses of goods and services and inviting their competitors into new developments, reinvesting in safely rehabbing schools to become 21st century equipped, families will move to areas that are safe, convenient with quality schools. Vacants to Value still has a lot of red tape and potentially excludes small businesses from the bidding process. Governor Hogan's effort is a huge step in the right direction, but will require great oversight as well as (safety concerns, bringing in EPA) appropriate removal and remediation lead, asbestos and mold</p>",
    "q6":"Chief barriers are that many neighborhoods generally have become unsafe and investors and businesses are hesitant to partner. In addition, many of the residents and job seekers are unable to meet the criteria due to risk assessments (criminal backgrounds and inadequate education and/or job training). I would first seek partnership with businesses that could manufacture, produce or provide good and services (peferably green) at a livable wage of $15.00 per hour despite some criminal history and minimally a high school diploma or equivalent. We have a great deal of unused land that could readily be made available to host such possibilities. In the interim, we have to invest in creating job readiness hubs of training for employment in demand. We have to revamp our law enforcement approach to community partnering, not engagement and re-prioritorize our crime fighting strategies to include greater substance abuse and mental health treatment while ensuring we are mindful of our returning citizens from the prison institutional settings.</p>",
    "q7":"I don't believe that the balance of power is balanced and as a council member I would introduce a charter amendment to reduce the powers of the Mayor to address appointments and would even seek a bifurcated process of partial appointment and electoral process of certain boards, Education, Estimates, etc.</p>",
    "q8":"The City Council's focus has been inconsistent and not cohesively in touch with prevailing issues. Crime has been a major focus which contributes to neighborhood flight and reduction, blight and an unwillingness of business investment. PREVENTION must become the focus and not just punishment. Employability is another issue. Temporarily holding a potential employer back from a background check does not help, but rather further frustrates the individual. As opposed to banning a box, lets incentify and create viable bonds for employers to be willing to take a chance. Banning the box was a start, but does not truly scratch the surface of promoting employability. The two greatest issues the City Council has addressed in the last four years are (1) body cameras and (2) homelessness.</p>",
    "q9":"First, 311 is horrific. Coding that simply answering my call is insufficient as a marker of good customer service. There must be ongoing audits and an established performance matrix to continually assess progress and areas for improvement. Requiring department representatives regularly attend community functions and community association meetings is the best way to gain first hand knowledge of the constituent's needs.</>",
    "q10":"Because I want to see a better Baltimore. The city is in crisis and has been for the last 15 years and we can't afford business and politics as usual any longer. This City and the people of it, to include my family, are the reason I am where I am today. Because the community took care of itself, we were stronger, safer and more unified. I want to see us return to a time of thriving and safer neighborhoods, quality city services and an accountable, accessible and responsive government putting the needs of the people before politics or party. I believe I have the most well rounded life, personal, professional experience to help transform Baltimore back to its solid foundation and beyond.</p>"

Education on how to save money, the best ways to spend money and where to spend money. In our schools we need to utilize technology ie: laptops, tablets and USB Drives for all children, not textbooks that are bad for the environment and become outdated every four years. We need a focus on a modern education for our young people so we produce adults that can effectively compete in this ever changing marketplace. However, education does not end there, we also need to educate our young people living outside of the law and make sure that they know that there are better ways to provide for their families then criminal activity. Many of the people that are loitering, hanging out on street corners and committing crimes are really potential entrepreneurs who have become misguided and need direction. Through job education they could be trained to take whatever it is they're passionate about and create a business from that . Taking these measures will make them productive members of society not part of the problem.</p>",
    "q2":"Baltimore has not been pursing the right strategies to reduce violent crime because we are plagued with record shattering numbers. It is time to pivot and try some new ideas. There needs to be a focus on teaching conflict resolution and how to talk through disagreements. It is an absolute tragedy that our city's homicide rate was over 300 people in 2015. We must reverse this trend! I feel that our current Police Chief Kevin Davis has not been given a chance to prove what he can do because he has been in his office for less than a year, so it is too soon to judge him. However, he is responsible for the actions of his officers. We desperately improvement in police-community relations. In terms of diversity, we have to make sure our police officers look like the communities they serve and protect. They should reside in Baltimore and be held accountable for their actions, not protected for aggression. Baltimore Police should stop over policing our neighborhoods. We have to get to the point where children want to grow up and become police officers again. In order to do this they (children) have to feel like they are seeing 'Officer Friendly' - not an occupying military force. Yearly mental screenings should be conducted on all patrol officers to root out racist or overly aggressive people on the police force. Lethal force should be used as a last resort, not the first action!</p>",
    "q3":"The death of Freddie Gray shined a bright light on the need for the re-training of our police force. Luckily, Freddie Gray's arrest was caught on cell phone video, if not this case may have been swept under the rug completely. The protests and unrest are the result of Baltimore's frustration with police brutality, lack of opportunity, lack of resources and mistrust of the government.</p><p>I love the city of Baltimore, but if we continue to elect people with poor leadership qualities that don't take responsibility for their own mistakes, then things will continue to get worse. If we continue to have city council members that do not represent the people of the district: their wants, needs and their struggles, it's going to get worse!</p>",
    "q4":"Baltimore should reduce its property tax rate. We have one of the highest in the area. I understand why it is advantageous to develop a place like Harbor Point, but at the same time these type of TIF and PILOT for other areas around the city in desperate need of development.</p>",
    "q5":"Mayor Rawlings-Blake has made a commitment to grow the city by 10,000 families thru Vacants to Value but I don't think enough people know about this program. I do not think the incentives are as attractive as some other attempts at development. The recently announced Project C.O.R.E, or Creating Opportunities for Renewal and Enterprise, kicked off last month in the Sandtown-Winchester neighborhood. The goal here is to replace as many full blocks of blight as possible over the term of the project with green space that they hope will be more attractive to sell. They are reporting that 20 blocks will be done in the first year, so that remains to be seen. But I think we could do better and take it a step forward by actually building homes on the properties and truly lead by example. Instead of just knocking down the buildings and putting down a field why not erect a livable space focused on completing 10 blocks start to finish.</p>",
    "q6":"True opportunities for urban growth is what is hold economic development back. The scale are stacked too much in favor of people other than to poor. So we must balance the scales and focus more attention on developing small business.</p>",
    "q7":"Baltimore has one of the strongest Mayoral systems in the country. If you have a visionary in office - this is an inspiring thing but if the Mayor lacks vision, the power they possess can be frustrating for the City Council. The requirement for a three-fourths legislative vote to override an executive veto is too high and very rarely achieved and should be lowered.</p>",
    "q8":"The City Council has touched some important issues like Baltimore Police wearing body cameras, the confirmation of Police Chief Kevin Davis and the plan to sell four city-owned parking garages to raise money for improvements to recreation centers and pools. However they is still more work to do.</p>",
    "q9":"The handling of snow emergencies, snow removal etc is something which we need to improve on. Trash removal is another area that improvement is needed in. 2 trash days per week and a more concrete mandatory recycling system should be put into place to help reduce rodents. The citizens of the city need a direct line of communication that can help with reporting service needs etc.</p>",
    "q10":"I am running for office to knock down the barriers that are holding my community back. For the last 20 years, things have become progressively worse. The 8th District needs a Councilman that can effectively engage young people to become involved in the political process, because they are our future - but at the same time, effectively addressing the needs of seniors and other adults in the community. After the uprising of 2015, we can no longer stand on the side-lines and assume the same old politics as usual have our best interests at heart!</p>"

    "q2":"Based on 344 homicides in 2015 I would say NO. One of the strategies we must implement is redirecting resources to focus on illegal guns, which means armed criminals and illegal carrying of guns. We must ensure that officers have the resource and man power to effective carry out this task. The police department leadership is going to need more strategies and resources toward reducing violent crime especially if our communities want to see sustainable results. While building a better relationship with the community in the hopes of increasing community assistance with bringing down violent criminals helps, those impacts probably won't be seen for years. Officers must be fully engaged and active in the community. Officers must serve as role models, mentors, and mediators. Officers train and equip citizens with tools and resources to promote safety, cultural understanding, and respect. Community members should know their officers by name.</p>",
    "q3":"I've learned that to gain the trust of the public our officers need to be more than just law enforcers, but officers need to be community advocates/supporters, engagers and protectors. Officers need to ensure that everyone and fellow officers embrace cultural diversity. Officers need to be very visible, and appreciate, validate, and acknowledge all residents as human beings. I also recognize the need for transparency with arrest and transportation to detaining centers, and think we are progressing with the recent deal to bring in police body cameras.</p>",
    "q4":"There is no quick fix to lowering Baltimore City property tax rates but the \"Targeted Homeowners Property Tax Credit\" passed by city council is a good start and we should start feeling its impact being that 20.9 million has been included for Fiscal Year 2016 (7/1/2015 to 06/30/2016), but more work is needed because of the lack of casino revenues which were meant to assist with this reduction. We also need to stop offering big corporations and developers tax breaks that don't create more tax revenue within three years of opening. To address lowering property tax I would support a budget review with the purpose of finding currently funded inefficient programs and consider moving funds from those programs to replace loses from lowering the property tax rate. Baltimore's use of PILOTS & TIFS to encourage business development is good for downtown business, but doesn't seem to be encouraging business development elsewhere. We need to find ways to encourage more development outside of downtown.</p>",
    "q5":"First we must make sure communities outside of the downtown area are safe and include resources that assist residents with finding a job and getting out of debt. Improving crime rates and economic conditions is always the start of revitalization. The Vacants to Value program and Governor Hogan blight elimination plan needs more community involvement to prevent creating semi-destroyed neighborhoods and disregarded open space.</p>",
    "q6":"We need to offer more support for small business growth and not just look to big developers as a quick fix, like we did with the casino. We could do this by offering tax credits for the first three years for any small business that hires recently unemployed Baltimore City residents. We also need to look into improving public transportations routes to better assist residents with reducing the cost and inefficiencies of traveling to work.</p>",

We should also develop a better understanding of which streets have the most traffic and are most susceptible to damage due to weather events like snow storms. Lastly, I believe we should have a plan in place to offer free parking on city properties in preparation for snow storms and include streets surrounding these properties in our emergency snow route procedures.</p>",

    "q1":"Among the numerous issues to be addressed in the 9th District, jobs and housing are priorities. The 9th District has a disproportionate number of adults out of work and families living below the poverty line, so we need to create jobs as well as provide training and placement. Baltimore must emphasize workforce development in areas of expected job growth. This means creating incentives for local hiring and forming partnerships with educational institutions to provide training for careers in technology, healthcare, and green industry. We must also partner with faith-based and community organizations to secure grants for youth jobs and ex-offender re-entry programs.</p><p>The 9th District has a large amount of vacant properties which further destabilizes communities. The City must utilize available resources for demolition to clear neighborhoods of dangerous eyesores. It would also be appropriate to raise the penalties for abandoned and nuisance properties, while lowering property taxes for responsible homeowners. Baltimore should also revisit the idea of providing vacant properties at a discount to individuals and groups. Another necessary step is reducing bureaucratic red tape to create a more efficient and streamlined permitting process; this would make it easier for those seeking to rehabilitate houses.</p>",
    "q2":"We could definitely make the system more efficient by focusing less on non-violent offenders and more so on violent crime. Far too often, violent repeat offenders are back out on the streets to commit another crime. Truth in sentencing would help in this regard as those convicted would be expected to serve the time given. As a father and husband, safety is a top priority for my family.</p><p>Community oriented policing and increased foot posts could also help in this regard. It is important for officers to get out of their cars and walk neighborhoods; this would help build relationships in the community and create a certain level of trust. With these elements in place, people would be more willing to make complaints and the police would get better information -- thus helping to cut down on the many cases of no prosecution due to insufficient evidence.</p><p>As one who is raising a family in Baltimore, I want to our neighborhoods to be safe for everyone. It is also important to address the root causes of crime in our communities. To this end, we must provide more constructive recreational opportunities for young people as well as partner with locally-based companies to sponsor summer and year-round jobs. Keeping our kids in productive activities helps reduce crime and increase public safety.</p>",
    "q3":"Police officers must be trained in community policing techniques, including de-escalation. This needs to be part of a comprehensive emphasis on foot posts and neighborhood services. Cultural competency training should also be a mandatory component of introductory and ongoing education. Police officers who engage in excessive force, especially repeat offenders, need to face harsher consequences and be removed for such behavior. This should be stipulated in their employment agreements at the outset. </p><p>Additionally, the unrest speaks to underlying disparities in education, housing, and employment that have gone unaddressed in West Baltimore for years. This is particularly pronounced among many of our city's youth who have felt ignored and neglected. Therefore, we need comprehensive strategies to invest in chronically underserved communities. In the immediate aftermath, it was encouraging to see the multitude of local groups who came together to serve the community in a time of crisis. </p>",
    "q4":"Potential homebuyers make calculations about what they can afford to spend on a mortgage and taxes. In light of the high property taxes, many make the rational decision to live outside of the City where taxes are cheaper. In Baltimore City, the high tax rate prevents businesses from locating here and discourages families from purchasing homes. Therefore, the City must reduce taxes across the board, and offset the lost revenue by auditing government agencies to cut waste. It would be feasible to reduce the property tax rate by 30-35 percent over a four year period.</p><p>If Baltimore provides incentives and breaks to encourage development, a significant investment must also be made in our neighborhoods. The establishment of community benefit agreements provides an avenue for responsible development in conjunction with a targeted impact in the surrounding area. It is possible to have a double bottom line: making a profit while also providing an economic return to the people of Baltimore. </p>",
    "q5":"While the money for demolition and redevelopment is necessary, the City must ensure that communities are not left behind and have a voice in the process. Likewise, the disposition of vacant housing is critical, however there must be opportunities for smaller scale contractors and developers to participate. Some houses could be turned over to individuals and community organizations with the resources to renovate them. This would also provide job training for vocational students and make affordable homeownership a reality for neighborhood residents. </p><p>Additionally, Community Land Trusts have proven to be effective in maintaining affordable housing and taking it out of the speculative market. Also, the multitude of abandoned houses and vacant lots presents an opportunity for community gardens and urban agriculture to combat food deserts. This would not only beautify neighborhoods, but would also address health and food disparities by providing access to locally grown produce.</p>",
    "q6":"One barrier is the inability to recognize existing markets. For instance, in many neighborhoods there are no full service grocery stores; however, there are clearly potential shoppers. I believe that people should have access to a variety of amenities and services so they can patronize local establishments and keep money in the community. As a former transportation planner, I understand that a comprehensive public transit system is needed and long overdue. The proposed Redline would have connected people to jobs and services while promoting economic growth by spurring mixed-use development including housing and retail.</p><p>Another obstacle is insufficient workforce preparation. In order to spur equitable development and decent jobs, we need to incentivize investment local hiring and training. But we must also be able to connect our residents to these jobs. As economic development is central to the future of the 9th District, we must revitalize commercial corridors such as Edmondson Avenue and West Baltimore Street. This means supporting existing businesses and recruiting new ones. This is also crucial to creating local employment, which is necessary to increase the City's continually shrinking tax base.</p>",
    "q7":"Baltimore has an extremely strong mayor form of government. However, there are changes that could be implemented to give the City Council greater power. For instance, the number of council votes that it takes to override a mayoral veto should be reduced from the current threshold of 3/4 to 2/3, which would be in keeping with most other municipalities.</p>",
    "q8":"While the focus on audits was a step in the right direction, it did not go far enough to address systemic financial irregularities and mismanagement. There must also be increased attention on how to streamline government agency operations to make them more efficient. Also, the emphasis on funding for youth programs is something that is appropriate and must be expanded.</p>",
    "q9":"We must make the 311 system more responsive by not closing out complaints that are left unaddressed. In addition to increased communication and coordination to speed up response times, persistent complaints must be prioritized. Also, progress reports from agencies would make them more accountable to City residents.</p>",
    "q10":"My wife and I are homeowners who are raising our children here. We love Baltimore and want to see our city reach its full potential. I am determined to create a better environment for my sons to grow up in and a place where my wife and I can grow old together. I want to serve on the City Council because we need competent leadership who can articulate the interests of the community while creating effective public policy to move our neighborhoods and Baltimore City forward.</p>"

I would first research the cause of these issues, implement a strategic plan that provide information and resources that address the issues, and follow up regularly on the progress of the issues being resolved.</p>",
    "q2":"I do not have confidence in the Police Department's current leadership and do not believe that Baltimore is pursuing the right strategies to reduce violent crime. In order to effectively approach and resolve the issue of violent crime, you have to have an understanding of all areas of Baltimore and why and how things happen the way that they do. I would have more events and activities that promote regaining of trust and relationship building between the citizens and law enforcement. This will also allow questions to be asked, processes to be understood, and suggestions to be given that will benefit everyone as a whole.</p>",
    "q3":"The lesson I have learned is that an individuals background can have a great affect on the way he or she is treated by the justice system, which is not all the time fair. I have also learned that better resources need to be provided to the incarcerated that will effectively assist with their rehabilitation and will attempt to prevent then from being a repeat offender. Although protest have been effective in some circumstances, in most cases, other alternatives should and can be taken if you wish for your point to be taken seriously.</p>",
    "q4":"Baltimore should definitely reduce it's property tax rate, and can do so by providing resources and easier processes that will allow more utilization of Baltimore's abandoned properties. Although I disagree with the processes to encourage developments like Harbor Point, I understand the reason behind it. However, there are more areas that need attention and once tended to, can have a great affect on the reduction of reducing the property tax rate.</p>",
    "q5":"To encourage commercial and residential revitalization in neighborhoods away from the waterfront, Baltimore can allow not just major developers, but more non-profit organizations and potential individuals to follow necessary steps that will allow them to have ownership and be able to rehabilitate the abandoned houses and commercial properties. Vacants to Value is a very tedious process, that typically allow major developers to purchase homes at a low cost, rehab them, and sell or rent them out for an astronomical amount of money. Governor Hogan's efforts to combat blight does not effectively accommodate Baltimore as a whole. For my district specifically, it will produce more pollution, rodents, and potentially eliminate neighborhoods altogether due to the abundance of vacant properties.</p>",
    "q6":"The chief barriers to economic development and job creation in Baltimore is poor budgeting of the finances and lack of effective planning.</p>",
    "q7":"I believe the current balance of power between the Mayor and City Council is appropriate. However, the issue is some of our current leadership have become complacent and don't wish to take the time to effectively plan before executing.</p>",
    "q8":"City Council has not been focused on the right issues. The main focus has been accommodating only certain areas of Baltimore with the exception of the more rural communities. They have been overlooked and neglected.</p>",
    "q9":"The weaknesses I see in the delivery of city services, is lack of urgency and resources to resolve issues. Issues can be categorized by urgency and regularly scheduled follow ups and audits can be done to confirm the issues have been addressed, and or, resolved in a timely manner. An attempt to recruit more volunteers to assist with addressing the concerns as well. Those seeking or needing to complete customer service hours can be utilized. Or those simply seeking experience. Each Council representative should be responsible for staying on top of making sure these services have been provided.</p>",
    "q10":"I am running for office because of my genuine concern for progression instead of regression, as well as, being an individual who plans strategically and will exhaust all efforts to effectively get results, which is what our city currently need. I have lived in my district the majority of my life and a lot of the community's issues directly affect my family and it's time for much needed change, which I can very much so assist with due to having a great understanding of these issues.</p>"

They are our Leaders of Tomorrow.</p>",
    "q4":"I see taxes as a way to show citizenship and residential dependability in various ways to provide support and services when funds and other necessities are unavailable within the prospect but necessary to continue associations and beneficial strategies to accrue and sustain. The city has always been a phenomenom to my perceptions. Formerly as a resident of Atlanta and growing up in the South. I did not see as many programs and available relationships with seeing the people for each and every merit of their social classes and susceptibility to compromise. Further encouragement does not deter the obvious decline and ever-changing standards of humanity. and it is always our duty to achieve or prevail out of those confines through programs and incentives found in the criteria of those with the accessible revenue or methods of development while others are not so lucrative and at a standstill.</p>",
    "q5":"There are so many families and caretakers of children as well as single males and other programs looking for dwellings or places to support a healthy relationship with living, occupation and child rearing. To target those who cannot reside in those higher cost or faster paced environments and relieve them of any substantial interferences of becoming successful, involved, sustaining and taking ownership of their own livelihood would be a great incentive when established and provided with the same quality of community. Same goes for stores and merchants found in the same, in order to be involved and painstakingly secure your revenue, you have to nurture and upkeep what you have found to gain as a viable alternative. Reform could be an easy task to develop out of Governor's effort as a means of support to continue establishing healthy outlooks but our citizens, leaders and the communities must be able to relate and shown the associations which make it a credit to their everyday relationship with betterment of each effort. Moral must be established on all parts.</p>",

Obligating myself already to multifacets of these procedures begun as soon as I assisted the first person sitting next to me in the library one day with simply understanding how to post their resume and directing them to Career Services within the same environment. To one another we owe the act of information, support and follow up. We have a thriving city with so many forms of possibilities it takes a know how and the positive can do attitude which one person can easily excite another to develop better habits and suggestions for employment, education and organizations or supportive services for their times of need to fulfill their quality of respect to reinter into those places seeking job situations and know home life has some form of significant support. In the same manner of speaking as I deliberated an outcome just now is the ongoing measures of practice I provide daily and share with the masses to continue a state of mind instilled in each every scenario. You, I or All can make it!</p>",
    "q7":"I'm sure that within the ranks there are always communication as well as miscommunication, for all I've seen it's mostly the waiting game for outcomes to occur, and in order to do my fair share it would definitely rely on being engaged and involved with any or all issues being faced, awaiting decisions or simply in need of my attention. Staying abreast and informed and affirmed through concentration on ethics, performance and completion.</p>",
    "q8":"Yes and the interests vary based on the challenges targeting individualised circumstances not those which can be handled overall. I've noticed housing has been one of the major grievances as well as various forms of harassment. To see these circumstances out of the limelight and put into a perspective to create a harmonious accord amongst ongoing situations that develop momentarily and remain current to everyday living establishes for the Council it's need and focus. I if involved would particularly assure more simple related compromise reflects the community involved with itself to discontinue such impractical performances over issues that can be handled locally through a viable chain of service which also has to be evaluated and reevaluated to remain in the forefront and creating healthier decision makers and more problem solvers amongst our citizens.</p>",
    "q9":"The various issues are more based on quality assurance and involved with sustaining viable enthused city employees and workers to coincide with our ever changing public. How do we know? Basically because we are them and we live within the same social circles and customer service related skills both in the workplace and representing the City of Baltimore outside of the workplace. If annotations and requests or follow ups are dated and submitted, the practical order would be to handle the most severe cases initially and continue the code for conduct and service until all proceeding issues are accomplished whether inside of one significant makeup for a single issue with multiple cases. To explain it to your neighbor as you would your co workers, as you express in detail to the resident or person in need of your commitment and dedication as a part of the whole experience to end or discontinue an unsatisfactory state explains detailing and progress reports with signatures and time related markers is never too much paperwork or effort, but moreso assuring that there could never be no less than an admirable turn around time or time management to accrue a solution and resolve circumstances amicably. Communication we find patiently to express plainly to interact daily makes up for any challenges we may think might cause a barrier in relating.</p>",
    "q10":"To support and redevelop/reform my community. Provide better educational programs, healthier outlooks and safer streets. Our Community has been vandalized and saturated with crime, drugs, violence and deaths. It's prioritizing ourselves as Neighbors and Our Own Community Advocates to better insure a Quality of Life for Our Youth, Elderly and even those looking to build, live or support our Community as Merchants and Business Owners who provide good and services for our beloved neighborhoods. We could use these opportunities during our elections to set trends and create perspectives for change.</p>"

To increase job opportunities, I am drafting legislation that mandates local hiring policies for businesses that take root in the community.

I am confident in the current leadership's ability to engage the rank and file and to return community policing back directly into our neighborhoods with increased visibility, outreach, and cooperation. To improve police-community relations, I would support increased police visibility utilizing more foot patrols, less \"in car\" time, and creating opportunities for cadets to become immediately engaged in the process of building community relations upon graduation from the academy.</p>",
    "q3":"The conditions that set off the unrest after the death of Freddie Gray have existed for some time. People's frustration climaxed as injustice was televised around the country. Citizens expressed discontent with violent and nonviolent impact on their own community. The takeaway is that we must be better listeners when people feel unheard and disenfranchised. We must be better equipped to assess community needs and fulfill the voids.</p>",
    "q4":"Baltimore must stabilize the tax rate before it can reduce the tax rate. The major source of revenues in Baltimore City is derived from property taxes at the property tax rate described by law. City services and programs are funded through the collection of these taxes and I support a reduction in taxes, however, not with a reduction in services and programs. The property tax rate can be reduced when the source of revenue is stable and the reduction is funded through other grants and funding sources which creates a balanced budget. If tifs are to be used, they should be used in communities. Recently, I used a tif to reduce the affordable housing rental rate in a development project. As part of the community benefits agreement, the developer will return fund back to the community over the life of the project. A similar agreement is in place with the Innovation Center to be built on W. Baltimore Street. The community benefits agreement associated with this tif, requires that funds be placed in the community surrounding the project for several years beyond the development of the property.</p>",
    "q5":"Development is attracted to stable communities where there is an upwardly mobile population. There must be a reduction of crime, an increase in successful educational outcomes i.e. more graduates and more college acceptances. Utilizing some of the same financial tools that we utilize in waterfront and harbor development i.e. pilot, tifs, and rise, will help spread development in our neighborhood. I am still in the evaluation process of the V2V program, however both V2V and blight reduction help stabilize neighborhoods making them more attractive towards development. Recently this month, a developer flew into Baltimore to look at opportunities in the 9th district. We discussed the 1000 block of Stricker Street, which was the first block demolished under the blight reduction program. A vacant, graded area provides a quick start for development.</p>",
    "q6":"High crime, a declining population,and civil unrest create a barrier to development in Baltimore City. The barriers to job creation are similar to the barrier to development, because as expansion occurs, so are jobs creates. For example, in developing a housing project, there are opportunities not just for employment but also for upwardly mobile apprentices with skilled unions. Therefore the greater the number of union construction projects, the greater the opportunities for sustainable jobs that pay livable wages.</p>",
    "q7":"No the balance power is not appropriate; Baltimore is a mayorial run city. The budget, Board of Estimates, city services, appointments, and third party programming are all controlled by the mayor. Charter amendments, authorizing the city council to directly affect the budget, would in part create parity between the council and mayor. Currently, the mayor controls 3 of the 5 votes on the Board of Estimates. Reducing the Board of Estimates to 3 members, the mayor, president of city council, and comptroller, would also help level the playing field.</p>",
    "q8":"The council's focus has been correct but not successful in addressing services and activities for our youth. In the 9th district, our focus has been on housing starts, health, and economic development; all of which are moving forward.</p>",
    "q9":"Repetitive city services should be reviewed and analyzed in real time for their efficiency i.e. trash collection, street cleaning, recycling. Skill standards, which allows cross training of employees, is seldom utilized in Baltimore City. Practices such as these can be reintroduced to maximize efficiency and broaden the workforce without requiring new hires.</p>",
    "q10":"-To rebuild the 9th district, not just it's infrastructure, but it's people as well.</p><p>-To eliminate the disparities that cause a section of the 9th district to have a 30 yr less life expectancy than in more affluent parts of Baltimore City</p><p>-To help constituents retool through education in various programs so that they can earn a livable and sustainable wage and qualify for new jobs and careers</p><p>-To expose our youth to choices they may not have thought possible through programs like the CURE program at UMD or Usher's New Look Foundation at the Excell Academy</p><p>-To continue to advocate and lobby for more diverse housing to fulfill all of the housing needs in the 9th district</p><p>- To continue to work on policies and strategies that reduce crime in West Baltimore</p>"

    "q1":"First, they want to build an incinerator to overburden one of the most polluted communities in Baltimore City. We need to make the Maryland Department of Energy adhere to their own laws and not press this project forward under expired permits due to no construction in 18 months. Secondly, is the crime and prostitution. While working with the local police, it is not just enough just to text when you see something happening or call 911, you need to find out who owns these houses on your block where there is a consistent flow for drugs, prostitution and resale of stolen merchandise and call the absentee landlord and make them aware of the situation. Communities must start taking responsibility at the street level and work up using the framework of law already in place. The only way to get things done is to be consistent.</p>",
    "q2":"Police Officers are understandably working in a tough situation. If more community involvement was present, then I believe that the abuses that have been cited in the system will lessen. When no one is being held accountable for their actions, corruption is bred. Each person at the community level needs to be accountable for the street where they live. Residents need to change their mindset that someone else is going to take care of this. The deeper root cause of crime is the fractured family unit which has led to people making the wrong choices. Every community association needs to be active and call the local police district and utilize the police representation there. The officers come to the meetings with crime stats - engage them and learn how you can help.</p>",
    "q3":"I saw a city fed up with the status quo. The riots could have been about anything, but people are angry and do not even know what they are angry at. Freddie Gray was born to a drug addicted mother, haphazardly raised in the projects by a variety of people who were not his parents, and because of that he did not know what was right and therefore made wrong choices. He did not stand a chance, and this is the saddest aspect of his story. The monetary civil settlement, using taxpayer money, is being used to reward bad behavior, and I find this appalling. The people of Baltimore do not know that the anger they feel needs to be directed at the system that has failed them. Democrats have been in charge of that \"system\" FOR 50 YEARS, and the sooner the voters realize this, the sooner we can start educating people on how their elected officials have failed them. Consequentially, the Republican solutions will begin to make sense.</p>",
    "q4":"The property taxes should be reduced by 50% to be at least in line with our neighboring counties. To replace the reduced revenue, every agency in the City needs to be audited and the employees need to held criminally accountable for fraud and mismanagement of taxpayer funds. Instead of offering handouts to get businesses to come here, negotiate the tax incentive to a market rate; when you give something away for free does not have any value to the recipient. Small business would succeed better if the property taxes were lower thus producing reasonable rents instead of over-inflated property values.</p>",
    "q5":"If property taxes were lower thereby making housing more affordable neighborhoods would be able to assimilate revitalizing troubled properties one block at a time. Empty lots could be utilized for small parks featuring child friendly equipment and benches for socializing, or community gardens. Move home owners in using the Vacants to Value program and negotiate commercial property incentives to be affordable for small business owners. Vacants to Value is a good concept, but it needs to be audited quarterly so the City can monitor the true progress of the program and to verify the recipients continue to live in the home according to contract. Governor Hogan's initiative is a step in the right direction, if the funds are used as they are intended and not mismanaged.</p>",
    "q6":"There are three parts to economic development and job creation. First, there needs to be an incentive for a job creating businesses to move into the City or for residents to start a new business in Baltimore City. The second part is a work force with a strong work ethic. Thirdly, is to have accountable and transparent city agencies with streamlined processes. Decades of unaccountable city agencies have put us in this mess, but city employees and politicians need to be held responsible for their actions so the result will be that the next elected or appointed official takes the job seriously. If you do not perform then you should not have that job. If you mismanage funds, you are a criminal and need to be prosecuted to the law's extent. Compare this to what happens now, so-called Civil Servants getting a slapped on the hand and allowed to run again for another office all while still collecting a pension from the taxpayers. The people need to wake up and realize they are being robbed twice.</p>",
    "q7":"The balance of power should fall on the side of the City Council. 14 City Council members can represent the entire population of the City better than 1 mayor. The City Council will equalize the representation for each of the voters' concerns for their district. Regardless of the balance of power, the City Council needs to be more transparent. For an example of this, the City Council meets weekly, but the journal of minutes take more than a year to be posted for public viewing. If we can get new officials in place dedicated to making the city better rather than making a name for themselves and getting a pension, then we may have a foundation to build on.</p>",
    "q8":"The City Council has not been focusing on the right issues for the past 50 years. If they were, we would not be in this situation: spiraling towards bankruptcy, having riots, and increasing generational poverty. Change the makeup of the Council and you will change the results for the City and its residents.</p>",
    "q9":"Back to the core issue, we need to make each agency responsible for their own employees and the outcome of their actions by implementing community surveys, customer service training, and regular audits. Then the taxpayers will experience improvement. Make city employees wear name tags so they are not just someone doing a job anonymously. Have procedures in place for bad behavior and reward good behavior.</p>",
    "q10":"The people need a choice. There has been 50 years of FAILED democratic rule in Baltimore City. Our property taxes are over twice that of our neighboring counties and what do we have to show for it? The people need a voice that speaks to accountable government, small business to promote jobs, neighborhood revitalization, and school choice.</p>"

    "q1":"1. Lack of jobs-I will work closely to make sure development in Port Covington and Westport uses local labor, and provides the maximum benefit for the population of the district.</p><p>2. Transportation-We need to provide a comprehensive transportation plan which works now while planning to address the changing transportation needs and desires of our younger population. People need to have access to reliable and quick transportation to make them eligible for job opportunities.</p><p>3. Schools-We need to provide more funding for our schools and libraries. Community schools must be strengthened. </p><p>4. Fairfield incinerator- I am against the development of this. While it would bring jobs to my district, it will degrade the air locally and across the entire city. We can work on cleaner energy alternatives such as insulating houses and installing solar power, both of which will provide jobs but won't negatively impact the health of our citizens.</p><p>5. Grime-This goes together with crime but we need to work diligently to make sure streets, buildings and public areas are kept clean. It is a very simple concept but when an area is kept clean, people behave better. There are trashcans all over downtown but you can go miles in parts of my district without finding one. </p><p>5. Drugs and crime-Because of poor transportation opportunities drug addicts in parts of the district can not get to treatment centers. There needs to be more treatment centers accessible to my district. People can not get reliable transportation to the current treatment centers.</p>",
    "q2":"We are heading in the right direction in reducing violent crime. Murders are down and gun seizures are up. I believe the police department is pursuing the correct strategy in dealing with this. At the same time, there needs to be an adjustment in the long term crime strategy of Baltimore. We must treat drug addiction and the resulting problems (petty crime,prostitution etc.) as health issues. We need to allocate sufficient resources to the city health department to provide counseling, job training and addiction treatment so there is a much lower demand for drugs. I am pleased the police department has adjusted their patrol assignments to help officers become more integrated in their communities. The MD mediation center has been positive in handling police complaints. Body cameras will be a very positive step in improving relations and transparency. However, we must make sure there are serious penalties for tampering with or turning them off as this has been a problem in other communities. Efforts to provide education opportunities at low or no cost for police should be encouraged. Efforts to help police reside in the city must be expanded. There needs to be much more interaction between the community and police. PALs, community and police-sponsored events and police-sponsored summer camps will help bridge that gap between the police and the community. Building community trust through positive interactions with police must be at the top of the list of priorities for leadership officials.</p>",
    "q3":"There are many lessons to draw from the death of Freddie Gray. Government let him down throughout his entire life. He was lead paint poisoned - which I know a great deal about having testified before city council and the state legislature many times in hopes of getting stronger safeguards against lead paint. Much of his settlement was taken from him by a predatory settlement company. His death, no matter how it happened, was preventable if the police had used proper techniques and discipline. Freddie Gray's death brought to the surface the lack of proper training police receive. The only thing surprising about the protests and arrests was that they did not happen a long time ago. Our city has tremendous social problems but they can be rectified with good, smart, effective government.</p>",
    "q4":"Our long term goal should be to reduce the tax rate. However, I can understand why we are not in a financial position to do so immediately. What really keeps people from moving to, and causes people to move out of, the city is the perception and reality that taxpayer money is being misused and wasted. We have to focus on spending money prudently, with strong and effective fiscal oversight of spending. Too often TIFs and pilots and other incentives are given just as a reward for political contributions and I believe that is wrong. Current city leaders do not have a realistic concept of what they can offer developers and often give too many incentives for development. Harbor Point is a perfect example. We, in no way, needed to provide incentives for that development. TIFs, pilots and similar incentives should be used in areas that are harder to market and need real ways to encourage developers to consider construction. TIFs, pilots and other incentives should always come with very substantial concessions to residents in the form of job opportunities and mixed-income housing construction combined with better transportation opportunities.</p>",
    "q5":"With smart planning, libraries can be the center point for community development, surrounded by retail and mixed-income housing. This has been a centerpiece of successful development in Chicago and could be very applicable here. By using local labor being paid living wages, we can develop strong residential neighborhoods. But we must realize that there are several things that go into successful community development, not the least of which are local job opportunities and access to reliable transportation. </p><p>Vacants to Value is just a continuation of Mayor O'Malley's failed strategy. Demolishing buildings can be a good thing, but we need a real and thorough inventory of abandoned homes. There are huge areas of blight in my district and I think we need a better strategy that will work block by block to revitalize these neighborhoods, ensuring homes are safe and healthy while ensuring the entire neighborhood is revitalized, not just a single house.</p>",
    "q6":"As an employer in the city I have hired and employed many local residents. I have learned and become very familiar with the challenges and benefits of hiring the local labor force. I will sponsor a measure to raise the minimum wage in the city to $15 an hour by 2020. This has proven to be a successful economic tool to help bring people into the middle class and put more money into the hands of those that need it and will spend it. BEDCO must innovate to attract and grow companies that will create semi-skilled jobs to employ the typical resident of my district. We must continue to encourage our schools and community colleges to provide job training for real jobs that can be found right here in the city. We must strive to do anything and everything to keep our city dollars circulating within the city by creating more job opportunities, local retail opportunities, and local entertainment. I will work with the retail stores in my district to encourage cooperation in advertising and promotion. Having been a successful retailer and wholesaler I know many ways to help local retailers grow and attract business.</p>",
    "q7":"The League of Women Voters did a study and recommended a significant change in city government. I agree with them and would work to enact a charter amendment to change the board of estimates to three votes: the mayor, city council president and comptroller. I was a leader for question P and we would again form a coalition of progressive groups. This may not seem germane to the question, but I would also work to provide public financing for city elections. I believe this would greatly reduce the reliance on corporate money for funding and lessen the influence of corporate donors on city leaders (especially the mayor). I would also work to effect a significant change in city elections by using an open primary type system, with all candidates, regardless of party affiliation running and the top two vote winners running in the general election. This would serve to loosen the power of incumbency and potentially make more council members willing to stand up to the mayor.</p>",
    "q8":"The city council is held back by a general unwillingness to exert influence. The council members too often react to news stories and hold hearings to rectify situations that should have been addressed long before they became serious problems or public outcries. The council failed miserably over the last several years to properly oversee and work as a watchdog to prevent police misconduct and inefficiency. Another huge issue that the council has neglected is fiscal oversight. The audits of city agencies should have been required every two years, but my opponent led the fight to water down that bill. Requiring agencies to submit to audits every four years and then delaying the audits to the point where they are obsolete has not only destroyed an opportunity to save millions of dollars, but has led to more money being wasted. This lack of accountability by city agencies and the city council's complicity in it is a terrible blow to any efforts the council can make to regain the trust of our citizens. This fiscal irresponsibility also makes it extremely hard to make any case for the state to give more money to the city (which it rightfully should once we get our financial house in order).</p>",
    "q9":"City services must move from a system of reactive maintenance to one of preventive maintenance. Management in many departments responds when needed, but does not anticipate problems before they happen. 311 is a good system for tracking response time but unfortunately oftentimes is the only catalyst for action. Department heads must be responsible for making schedules both short term and long term for repairs and maintenance. Fixing roads before they become dilapidated, trimming trees before they become a hazard, inspecting poles before they rust out and fall down should all be in a service plan that saves time and money.</p>",
    "q10":"I am running for office to make significant changes in Baltimore. I will work to ensure my district is not ignored or neglected by city hall officials. I want the residents of District 10 to have all of the same opportunities for success that those living in areas outside the city have. Baltimore has been mismanaged with poor delivery of services for too long and it needs to stop. Our tax base is diminished and we haven't been innovative enough in trying to attract business. Our entire city government has lost respect throughout the state and has lost the trust of our residents. District 10 reflects a snapshot of all of the city's problems because it has been ignored by our leaders. I believe we need a councilman who is planning to be in office for a full term because we have several long term challenges such as the repair or replacement of the Hanover Street Bridge and development in Port Covington and Westport . I plan to follow the model that councilwoman Mary Pat Clarke has set in her district. Her energy and communication skills have served her district well and I believe her enthusiasm needs to be matched in every city district.</p>"

    "q1":"I believe that most of the pressing issues within the 10th district reflect the issues endemic to the city as a whole. Crime, substance use, a broken educational system, the deterioration of the family, unemployment, and a lack of pride in our community are plaguing our city. These are symptoms of an underlying problem within our nation. Our citizens have become disenfranchised, they have lost faith in their government and in themselves. John F. Kennedy said \"Ask not what your country can do for you, but what you can do for your country. \" This statement is more apropos today than ever before. Our citizens have lost touch with the American spirit where individuals have faith in themselves to be the agents of change within their circle of influence. Drive through Baltimore and see the sorry state of affairs within our city. Trash litters our streets. School-age children roam the streets unsupervised, unguided. Mothers and fathers no longer parent (perhaps because they are working two to three jobs to pay the rent) their children but instead leave them unsupervised in the streets or in front of the television. Other parents cannot even do that turning instead to substances that dull their own pain. We are failing our children, and they are the future of our city. As a society we are now reaping what we have sown and our children are paying the price.</p>",
    "q2":"I think Police Commissioner Kevin Davis has accepted a very challenging position. Not only does he have to deal with the distrust of the citizens of Baltimore towards the police, but he has to deal with officers who are feeling alienated and disenfranchised as well. In my discussions with other citizens, they have recalled a time when police officers were more active members of their communities, when they were at the rec centers playing basketball with the youth (something that I believe the Commissioner has attempted to reinstate) and when they served as mentors and role models to our children. Like so many other relationships in our community, the relationship between the police and our citizens has changed in a very significant way. We need to hire more officers committed not only to protect and serve Baltimore but to also be a part of the community</p>",
    "q3":"As a parent, I can only imagine the pain of losing your 25 year old son, especially when he was in police custody. Mr. Gray's death served to ignite the underlying frustration and anger of a community. However, we need to take this painful episode in our history and continue a dialogue to ensure fair treatment of Baltimore citizens by the police and renew a commitment to work as a community to end the violence that has held its grip on Baltimore for too long. Police-violence aside, the violent crime rate within our city has spiraled out of control. Police have been overwhelmed and under supported. For both citizens and police alike, an us-versus-them mentality has developed that is unhealthy and dehumanizes each side in the struggle to re-establish a civil society. Police misconduct (including disrespecting or mishandling citizens accused of crimes) cannot be tolerated. But neither should we tolerate disrespect towards police officers who put their lives on the line in their service to the community. Respect is a two way street. When an officer orders a citizen to stop that is NOT a signal to run or engage in a fire fight. Everyone contributes to rebuilding the faith between the citizenry and its police.</p>",
    "q4":"Baltimore must absolutely reduce its property tax rate in order to attract new businesses and residents to move into the city thereby increasing the tax base. The current rates are the highest in the state and serve as a deterrent to families and businesses considering settling in Baltimore. The city could institute a 50% reduction in property taxes for three years for first time City home owners. A similar reduction could be offered for developers of new properties. It is my belief that this would allow for growth resulting in a higher tax base. With increased income, the Council should move forward to decrease property taxes across the board to bring them closer to rates in the counties.</p>",
    "q5":"Both of these projects could provide the starting point from which to revitalize parts of Baltimore.. However, my concern is that programs such as these can be magnets for abuse and fraud as political contributors and \"cronies\" can often reap the financial rewards without completing the task with which they were charged. Bids from contractors committed to hiring locally and perhaps providing job training for Baltimore citizens would allow for job growth as well as addressing the blight problem facing the city. These programs should be established with transparency and subject to frequent audits which assure accountability regarding the funds spent when compared to the progress being made. Neighborhoods throughout the city need to be safe and clean, They should include places where residents can gather, sitting on benches and picnic tables, to rediscover neighborhoods where families are connected to one another. Neighborhoods that accentuate and build on the beauty that was once Baltimore.</p>",
    "q6":"I believe that the issues raised in previous questions actually address this question. The high property taxes in Baltimore serve as a deterrent for many businesses. Furthermore, I believe the recent riots and high crime rate cause many individuals and businesses alike to shy away from considering Baltimore as a place to establish themselves. Trash, homelessness, and substance use problems also present significant obstacles for many businesses when considering Baltimore as a potential business site or for individuals trying to find a community in which to reside. The governing bodies of Baltimore cannot make significant changes in all of these areas without involving the citizens of Baltimore in improving our city so as to make it a more attractive place to be, Our leadership needs to address the issues which have hampered the city's economic growth. We need to encourage businesses to invest in job training so as to allow residents to gain the skills necessary to obtain employment at levels above minimum wage. We must also begin to address the issues of substance use and abuse, mental illness, and homelessness as these serve as barriers to individuals trying to improve their condition. </p>",
    "q7":"I believe the current balance of power between the legislative and executive branches of our city government is appropriate; however, like any system it is only effective with strong and active leadership. Many members of the current council have been in office for a long time and are likely to have become complacent and resistant to change. Rather than a change in the current structure of the city government, I recommend a change in leadership to revitalize and reignite the energy of the council. A number of Council Members have recognized this need and have decided not to run for re-election.</p>",
    "q8":"I think the Council has tended to be reactive as opposed to proactive. Furthermore, I believe that the Council Members should utilize technology such as social media and town hall meetings to maintain contact with their constituents. We need increase the amount of transparency in government and encourage constituents to regularly communicate with their elected officials.</p>",
    "q9":"I believe that our city employees can suffer from the same levels of complacency and disenfranchisement as the rest of our city. Hard work and commitment to customer service should be acknowledged and rewarded by city managers at all levels. Citizens should be encouraged to provide feedback and should also be contacted randomly to determine their level of satisfaction with city services.</p>",
    "q10":"I moved to Baltimore City late in 2012 from Anne Arundel County. Initially, I had come to the city to start a new life in a single family home that was similar to and built in the same year as my grandmother's. As I have travelled the roads of Baltimore I have been struck with a deep sadness for the state of our city and her residents. I believe that she deserves a chance to be restored to her former glory as a thriving city whose citizens have faith in Baltimore's leadership and are proud to proclaim themselves citizens of Charm City. I believe that individuals can make a difference in their communities and in the world; my intention is to create more transparency in city government and increase involvement of Baltimore's citizens in the government process either directly or through communication with me as their representative to the city council. Baltimore needs strong leadership that will encourage and motivate individuals and communities to pull together and rediscover the Spirit of Baltimore and to commit to providing a clean and safe environment in which all people, including those most vulnerable such as the elderly and children, can flourish. </p>"

    "q1":"The basic issues are the same for everyone, employment, education, good housing, safety, and access to resources. In the tenth we have some specific issues like environmental pollution, public health concerns. There are plans to build an incinerator in Curtis Bay. The CSX trains traveling through the area carry crude oil and explosives. There is the lack of an emergency evacuation plan for the people along the CSX route in case of an emergency. There are plans to build drug treatment facilities in the area. People need to understand what they are giving up for the sake of development and a promise of jobs. I am not against the development of jobs. I am against promising people jobs at the risk of their lives and their health and the health and lives of their children.</p>",
    "q2":"The strategies I have read in their Strategic Plan for Improvement seems cognizable however they have to balance that with the current demand their jobs place on them with the resources available to them and I don't see that happening. We need to aggressively pursue the crimes that violate our most core values while upholding our beliefs in fair treatment under the law. Police-Community relations will only improve when respect and real service is given. Most police will lock a person up before they help them. I think they should donate to a cause like MEAP or St. Vincent DePaul. I think they should be required to do community service like serve meals at My Sister's Place and Our Daily Bread. I know there are some existing structures in place whereby police attend community meetings but I don't think it is enough. Primarily because those meetings are between select members of the community and the majority of the community is not present because they don't know about them. The information about those meetings need to be dispersed to everyone in the community and far enough in advance to gain more participation. This is just not done and that is part of the reason the public has the perception it does of the police in Baltimore City.</p>",
    "q3":"People will be denied only for so long. The roles of the police have to be clear. They can not violate the laws they enforce even under color of right. Respect for the human they are dealing with is paramount. I understand the job of a law enforcement officer is a tough one and I feel for the families of the officers who recently lost their lives in the line of duty throughout this country. Loss of life is always devastating for those left behind. And to the one who made the sacrifice who has to endure the pain of death it is also a loss of all potential and their future. All I can say is respect life.</p>",
    "q4":"Yes. I am not sure how to cut the city's taxes. I would have to take a look at the city's existing budget and the areas that would be impacted if the taxes were cut. I definitely think they should be cut. I have spoken with several people about the issue and one of the reasons people have said they don't live in Baltimore City is because of the tax structure. Maybe if that changed and we found a way to cut property taxes without sacrificing already strained city services then we would attract more people to live in the area. Those same people might also put their business in Baltimore too. I have read about tax increment financing and I have a rough understanding of how it works. If the incentives are justified by the economic growth of the area if the project goes through and it comports with the rules and has no harmful impact on the local economy, environment, or significantly disrupts the lives of the residents of the neighborhood the project is located in then I am fine with a tif project. otherwise I think there ought to be careful and conservative use of this particular incentive to development. And there also needs to be some provisions in any tif agreement about the costs allocated if the project fails economically or otherwise.</p>",
    "q5":"I think the Govonor's program has good potential. I know a little about the Vacants to Value program as it has been around for a number of years. Unfortunately it appears that it has been underutilized.</p>",
    "q6":"The economic and tax structure of the city are the chief barriers to job creation and economic development in Baltimore City. I also think our transportation system and our access to resources are also a major impediment to growth. Baltimore's economy is largely services oriented and service driven. We don't have many manufacturing jobs. We need to understand the growing trends in the global economy and undertake to model our economic goals after them. I also think we need to be able to provide our residents with a way to get the most basic necessities so they will be able to get and retain competitive jobs. Many people who are worried about daily survival can't put their efforts into getting the resources and education necessary to get better jobs. I always believed the gateway to a better economy lay with the education of the people. There is a nursing shortage and a teachers shortage in Maryland. we need to train people who want jobs in these areas so they will get them. we need free or subsidized training programs to fill the need. We need to get your average every day person interested in education, information technology, the import -export business, the sciences and math. This will lead to people getting better higher paying jobs.</p>",
    "q7":"I believe this election will see a changing of the guard so to speak. Many people no longer have faith in the current administration. While the current council may have served the needed purpose when they were elected many people see the need for change. Maybe the current councilmen have become too familiar with each other or maybe they are disheartened by the issues that have plagued the city for so many decades. Being in public office can do that to a person. Maybe there should be a cap on the years a councilman can serve while still allowing them some retirement benefits. That might make for a wave of new faces and fresh ideas more regularly than we have now. What I see is we have the same people, the same problems and no real change in our circumstances. Maybe that's part of the problem.</p>",
    "q8":"I have reviewed some of the city councils legislation for the past few years and they seem to be focused on redistricting, zoning, housing development and land use and development and transportation. I think those are the issues that any city council has to deal with regularly.So to that end I will say yes they were focusing on the right issues but I think they could have focused more on the development of our schools and reduction of property taxes to encourage growth in the city and addressing the food deserts in our city and environmental pollution affecting our public health. Improvements in these areas lead to improvements in the areas the city has been focusing on.</p>",
    "q9":"City services are burdened by a lack of resources, money and manpower. those are the areas we need to improve on if we hope to get a faster response time to citizen concerns.</p>",
    "q10":"It is my desire to provide effective leadership to the residents and businesses in my district. I want to see positive change, and an overall improvement in the quality of life for people in the tenth. I would like to open a dialogue with the people so I can get an understanding of their needs and address them appropriately. There are several issues that need to be addressed and it takes several people to address them. I think I can help the residents and citizens of the tenth get where they are trying to go. It's ok to strive for a goal but eventually you have to get there.</p>"

    "q1":"There are several pressing issues in the 11th District, including public safety, quality of education, public transportation and access to jobs, and taxes.</p><p>Public safety - we need to advance the community policing model. I supported body cameras and will seek further policy changes to ensure effective community policing.</p><p>Quality of education – we need more community schools. I will continue to work hand-in-hand with Promise Heights in CW Baltimore and work with my State counterparts in the General Assembly to identify funding opportunities for additional community school programming. </p><p>Public transportation and access to jobs – we need a well-integrated public transportation system. I will continue to advocate for reform to MTA and fight for permanent funding for the Circulator and expansion of the system.</p><p>Taxes – we need to provide substantial tax relief for residents and businesses. I will continue to work with the Administration, the Council, and our State counterparts to identify and implement changes aimed at providing substantial tax relief.</p>",
    "q2":"Yes, Baltimore City is pursuing the right strategies to reduce violent crime. BPD is targeting violent offenders with our Federal partners (ATF, Drug Enforcement Agency, FBI, US Marshals, and US Secret Service) and working with the States Attorney to get these individuals off the streets. As of 02/08/2016, we have suffered 20 homicides, down considerably (about 25%) from this time last year. Other categories of violent crime which are down include rape and aggravated assault. Other strategies are aiding the crime fight, include a heavy emphasis on community policing, increased presence of patrolling officers (outside of their vehicles), and the recent body camera pilot program, which is expected to be implemented soon. </p><p>Yes, I have full faith in Commissioner Davis and was the first Councilmember to publicly support him after he was appointed by the Mayor. He seems to have a better relationship with the officers on the streets, as opposed to his predecessor.</p><p>Improving community and police relations is going to be a long process, and should be centered on rebuilding trust. BPD must have the trust of the neighborhoods it serves, and that starts with respect and better communication. During my tenure on the Council, I have focused a large portion of my public safety efforts on facilitating and improving communications between community and business leaders with BPD.</p>",
    "q3":"There are several systemic and underlying issues which exist not only in Baltimore, but across many large cities in America. Issues with community relations, policing practices, socio-economic disparity, and access to quality education, are all vital to the discussion. </p><p>The lesson I learned is how complex and intertwined these issues are and that we all need to work together to resolve these deep rooted problems. Addressing each issue individually will not resolve our problems. We need to focus on resolutions that address more than just one area. For example, if community and police relations improve, but we don't develop economic opportunities and jobs in places where they are needed most, the drug market will continue to disrupt these areas. If economic and educational opportunities are built, but the relationship and trust between the community and police fails to improve, then we will not be able to solve crime. </p><p>During my time as Councilmember, I've had the chance to meet and hear from people doing great work towards addressing these issues. I want to make sure these individuals have the opportunity to voice their opinions and be part of the discussions regarding how we grow stronger from this.</p><p>With respect to the City's response to the unrest, there were several lessons to be learned, none more important than the need for better communication from the City to residents and businesses. The Joint Information Center was a sorely needed step in the right direction.</p>",
    "q4":"In order to grow, Baltimore City needs to continue to reduce property taxes. While property taxes have incrementally decreased for principal home owners over the past few years, we need to continue to explore ways to provide substantial tax relief. Having been selected by the Mayor to serve on the Tax Policy Review Group, I've gained a better understanding of the many challenges and complexities we face in trying to find solutions that do not cut core services or negatively impact our bond rating. Perhaps the biggest obstacle is that we live in a City built for 1M, yet we have a population of about 630K. </p><p>The most significant thing we can do to decrease property taxes is to grow our population. The current Administration and Live Baltimore are pursuing a number of initiatives aimed at both retention and growth, and more can be done. </p><p>Many of the issues the Tax Policy Review Group explored have minimal impact on property tax reduction. SDAT reform, which is ongoing and requires General Assembly partnership, would provide for more accurate, fair, and equitable taxation. We need to address revenue loss such as property owners incorrectly receiving the Homestead Tax Credit, uncaptured tax on Air BnB transactions, and inaccurate assessments of commercial properties.</p><p>Because of the City's limited access to capital for infrastructure improvements, TIFs may be necessary to grow the City. As with any incentive, the Council should ensure it leaves the City in a better position as a result of the project.</p>",
    "q5":"With over 16,000 vacant homes in the City, this is and should be a top priority. The current level of blight is something that needs to be addressed as soon as possible. </p><p>Although the Governor's announcement appears to be grossly overstating the amount of new money available to Baltimore City, I am encouraged by new demolition funds being made available to the City. Combining the Governors proposed demolition funding with the City's increased financial commitment will help accelerate blight elimination. </p><p>Vacants-To-Value has been successful, particularly given the current economic environment. Since the inception of the program, as of August 2015, the City has demolished almost 1,300 vacant houses and sold over 800 vacant houses, of which approximately 300 occupancy use permits. </p><p>There are opportunities to do more, all with the goal of reducing the number of City-owned vacants. For example, there are other useful programs we should continue to leverage, such as the Baltimore Regional Neighborhoods Initiative (BRNI). State BRNI grants provide funding to community development corporations to implement neighborhood revitalization strategies within the State-designated sustainability areas designated by the Baltimore Planning Department. Having the Reservoir Hill area expanded to include Druid Heights in the 11th would make sense, considering its proximity to two anchor institutions, MICA and Coppin State, along the North Avenue corridor. BRNI grants provide additional funding to leverage existing investment, and have proven to be successful.</p>",
    "q6":"The chief barriers to economic development and job creation include a disproportionate property tax rate, lack of preparedness to take on jobs in the new Baltimore economy, the lack of a regional comprehensive public transportation system, and public safety perception and reality.</p><p>The disproportionate property tax rate compared to surrounding jurisdictions makes it more expensive and less attractive to develop in Baltimore City. With a property tax rate that is highest in the State, I will continue to support initiatives aimed at reducing our rate.</p><p>There is work to be done to ensure preparedness for jobs in the new Baltimore economy. This is one of the reasons I have been supportive of TechHire and incubators and accelerators.</p><p>Without a comprehensive public transportation system, access to existing and newly created jobs is a hardship for a large portion of the City's population. Amazon, which employs 3,600 people, has had to run its own transportation system with loans from the City. We need to work with the Governor to make sure Baltimore Link truly connects residents to jobs.</p><p>Public safety has an impact on economic development, whether it is perception or reality, and Baltimore City has a reputation that does impact some development. There is a perception that the City is unsafe and the reality is that the property tax rate is the highest in the state, creating an environment in which it is difficult for Baltimore to compete with surrounding counties.</p>",
    "q7":"Baltimore City has historically had one of the strongest Mayoral systems among large cities in the Nation. There are several proposed initiatives aimed at diluting the Office of the Mayor's power and shifting that power to the Council. While I am generally supportive, I think it is incredibly important to have an open dialogue about shared governance and the difference between the Executive and Legislative branches of government. Making changes to the City Charter should only be done if the result improves the way the City operates.</p>",
    "q8":"During my 16 months on the Council, I wish there had been more opportunities to discuss issues related to public safety, quality of education, public transportation and access to jobs, and substantial tax relief. </p><p>We have suffered an alarmingly high number of homicides and non-fatal shootings. The City cannot sustain another year of violence like we did in 2015. The Council needs to give more attention to this issue.</p><p>The Council's work on TransForm Baltimore is important, and it is imperative that we pass the new zoning code before the end of the term, as it is out of date and has not been updated in over 40 years. </p><p>The Council has also raised the importance of performance audits. Given my GAO background and experience, I believe that I provide a critical voice on the Council on effective auditing processes.</p>",
    "q9":"There are several quality of life issues which require immediate attention. For example, street lights should never be out for more than 24 hours, trash and recycling should always be picked up on time, and potholes should be filled within 7 days of being reported (all three examples are weather permitting, of course).</p><p>The 311 process is extremely frustrating for citizens. The process to request City services can be improved through streamlining inter-agency communications. Often times, a service request will be routed to the wrong agency, resulting in a service request being closed, then internally a new service request is created with a different agency. The citizen checks the status of the service request, the system indicates it is closed, with no explanation, and the issue persists, which in turn frustrates citizens. Our City needs a modernized 311 system which sends email, text, and phone alerts to citizens with status updates. A simple example is the tracking system UPS uses.</p>",
    "q10":"I never imagined a year and a half ago that I would be in this position. Bar none, this has been most rewarding experience of my life. It is a very challenging job and can be wildly frustrating at times -especially when the answer is right in front of you and we don't have the resources or power to fix the problem. I've done this job full-time since my first day, resigning from my previous position as an IT Auditor with the US Government Accountability Office the day I was sworn in. It is very humbling to represent the 11th District and I hope to continue to do so for 4 more years. I genuinely enjoy helping people solve problems and that is why I am running.</p>"

    "q1":"Crime, grime, transportation, taxes, and economic revitalization are a few of the pressing issues facing the 11th District. I encourage everyone to visit CurtisJohnson258.com to read about my policy positions in depth. Focusing on crime and economic development, I believe everyone deserves to feel safe in their communities, safe in their homes. I expect the police and our justice system to hold people accountable for the crimes they commit, no matter what side of the law they are on.</p><p>Ensuring officers are assigned to areas based on need, rather than appearance.</p><p>Push officers to double down on drug dealing in church and school locations.</p><p>Introduce legislation to fully fund the CRB providing investigative and subpoena power.</p><p>Press the Mayor to evaluate the 25-year retirement for BPD to assess economic gains versus recruiting and retention issues. </p><p>Work with state partners to find tax and salary incentives for officers to live in the city.</p><p>Work with the BPD to find ways to recruit city residents. </p><p>Making sure that the BPD reflects the demographics of the city.</p><p>The residents of Pennsylvania Ave, deserve the same focus on their neighborhoods as other parts of the city. Local jobs means less crime, less reliance on local assistance, and a better future for Baltimore.</p><p>Revitalization of the Pennsylvania Ave corridor.</p><p>Revitalize Howard Street corridor.</p><p>Work with City-Council Partners to reintroduce restaurant rating system.</p><p>Develop entry-level job training incubators for labor and skilled workers. </p><p>Provide tax-incentives to companies who hire full-time workers from the Summer Jobs program.</p>",
    "q2":"The steps outlined in the previous answer are the first steps to building a better, stronger relationship between BPD and the City.</p>",
    "q3":"The uprisings strengthened my belief that we need a strong relationship between our police and the community. After the uprising, I met with neighbors in Federal Hill. I told them the same thing I've said in Seton Hill and in Upton; I told them 'Call the Baltimore Development Corporation,' and tell them you want Pennsylvania Avenue to be revitalized. A better Pennsylvania Avenue is a better 11th District. Local jobs lead to less crime and a better economic future.</p>",
    "q4":"As a home-owner, I too feel the pain of the property taxes in Baltimore. As a parent, I share the concern of tax-breaks going to companies with no incentives going to our kids. We know that the tax breaks that benefit a few are hurting the many. Being elected, not selected, means working to find solutions that help all of Baltimore, not just a few. We need to start having a real honest dialogue about what we want for the future of our city. We need to look for long-term solutions for Baltimore's short-term tax issues that don't unfairly target homeowners.</p>",
    "q5":"As in some of my previous answers addressing our crime, grime, and tax issues will go a long way towards helping Baltimore grow as a city. The Governor's plans are a great first step so long that there is legitimate and substantive community input and engagement. However, they do not go far enough in addressing the systematic failures that led us to be in this position.</p>",
    "q6":"Again, we need to revitalize the Pennsylvania Ave and Howard St corridors. Also, we can build more entry-level business incubators Local jobs means less crime, less poverty, and a more solid homeowner base.</p>",
    "q7":"We need to evaluate how our city government works from top to bottom. The establishment has failed the residents of Baltimore and we need to start the dialogue now of how to improve as a city. If we expect to be a world-class city we must have a world-class government. Right now we have an establishment that benefits a few donors and no the people of Baltimore.</p>",
    "q8":"The City Council has many dedicated members, however as an institution, they have taken their eye off the ball. The fractured relationship between Baltimore and the community has led to an escalation of crime, stagnant growth, and demoralized neighborhoods. Recognizing that crime impacts every other area of the city's health is an important first start.</p>",
    "q9":"There is an overall lack of accountability when it comes to city services. People laugh at the suggestion of calling 311 to report an issue. The recent snow storm highlighted the failure of government to deliver a basic service. We need to immediately hold hearings to assess each city agency and hold them accountable for the tax dollars they are spending.</p>",
    "q10":"My mother was a high-school social worker for 40-years, a union president for eight. She currently owns her own Montessori school. I've taught 3-5 year-olds as well as autistic children. I know education from multiple angles. Every morning, my wife and I see the same drug dealer on our corner. With three schools in a two-block radius, there is nothing sadder than seeing children have to walk through a drug deal to get to school. We can do better.</p><p>After the uprising, I met with neighbors in Federal Hill. I told them the same thing I've said in Seton Hill and in Upton; I told them 'Call the Baltimore Development Corporation,' and tell them Pennsylvania Avenue to be revitalized. A better Pennsylvania Avenue is a better 11th District. Local jobs lead to less crime and a better economic future. </p><p>As a home-owner, I too feel the pain of the property taxes in Baltimore. As a parent, I share the concern of tax-breaks going to companies with no incentives going to our kids. We can do better.</p><p>Whether working for the U.S. State Department overseas, the Obama Administration, or the Maryland Department of Transportation, I have fought to improve the lives of others. I want to bring the same record of accomplishment to the Baltimore City Council. I'm committed to my son's future – his future is Baltimore's future! I will work to make a better Baltimore.</p>"

This district has some of the most beautiful streets and homes in the world. However, there are portions of the district that have not shared in the vigorous renovation and maintenance as others. In such the city must work with the Neighborhoods to provide the same high quality services and support throughout. I will start a campaign to shift the mindset on litter and aggressively target developers that dump trash in neighborhoods. </p><p>Parks and recreation centers have been the center of communities for generations young people need a safe clean place to be young people </p><p>We have to create a pathway for persons re-entering society to be able to participate in our society. We cannot continue to punish persons that have served their time and expect them to flourish and be productive members of society. We must provide an opportunity to vote. We must provide an opportunity for them to get their foot in the door of possible jobs we must provide opportunities for training in new fields that pay a living wage. </p>",
    "q2":"Violent crime reached a tipping point this past year. in that relationships are going to be stressed if we are grow as a city we have to find more equitable policing practices.Data shows programs that help Police Officers become residents of the community they serve and protect have had a profound impact. We should be investing in programs that help officers to do that. Maybe going so far as to say more of the force should be residents than not..</p><p>With this we must keep in mind the crime issue does not exist in a vacuum. Crime is a result of any myriad of mitigating issues. Some of which are within our power to solve. Education leads to jobs , jobs lead to lowered participation in criminal activity, its fairly simple. Lastly there has to be some attention paid to persons returning to society from criminal dentition. These folks need opportunities that simply do not exist right now. We need to make it more advantages for them to pursue education and employment than crime.</p>",
    "q3":"Protests following Freddie Gray's death should have provided a major lesson for our elected officials. Unfortunately, all the lessons were not even acknowledged let alone addressed. Our city's youth are angry, our city's youth feel ignored, our city's youth lack opportunities to break generational barriers find success. Beyond our youth we have entire segments of out population that have lost the ability to effect change for their personal situation let alone their family's. History has taught us again and again people will not stand for this. People will find a way to be heard. If we are to move forward elected officials are going to have to be more inclusive in their practices. Stakeholders are going to have to be brought to the table and given an opportunity to develop solutions. The youth and disenfranchised adults must be given opportunities to grow and and advance.</p>",
    "q4":"The city's tax practices created a major problem with City Schools funding. This would not have been as major an issue if we were drawing taxes from those projects. Additionally we are looking at projects to major developers that are building large rentals spaces. Renters are not providing a large portion to the tax pool in the short term. I would like to see more incentives to those business to restore homes in existing communities and provide opportunities for home ownership. Finding ways to bring in both business and home owners will create a more stable tax structure. This will require a few more steps when planning out the policy but it would be well worth the effort. These steps may look like tiered reduction in property taxes for home owners and some combination of financial incentives for businesses.</p>",
    "q5":"The Vacants to Value program on the surface is excellent, for developers However the is little incentive for them to create affordable housing without over populating the property. This has been the big push-back from associations not wishing to loose the history and heritage of their neighborhoods. The program should be in place to promote investment in affordable housing in some of the most in need areas. This will require a high level of planning on the revitalization front. Our neighborhoods want revitalization not necessarily gentrification. Some of these areas given the proper support could revitalize them selves. I would like to look in policies that empowers and provides incentives to neighborhood associations to lead the charge in ensuring equitable changes are made.any given site.</p>",
    "q6":"An employable work force is an avoidable barrier to economic growth. Baltimore is poised to have major growth in medical services, micro manufacturing, and technology sectors. Investments in education in and out of schools. These fields have scores of vacancies and the employment deficits growing every quarter. Strategic recruitment of organizations that are interested in developing people and communities will be an essential component in our cities economic development . Providing incentives organizations that hire locally and base themselves within the community is an important economic tool that the city wields. However, the practice has caused a lack of tax revenue. Plans must be put in place to offset those loses with new families moving into the city and city renters to become home owners. A smarter more efficient pathway to homeowner will create a space for economic growth. If we can then tie the recruitment of business, and a growth of home ownership, we could afford investments in education of a new modern workforce. With a competitive workforce we can bring more business into the city. Thus, we will have created a growth cycle.</p>",
    "q7":"I would seek to see how much we can change working withing the current structure. If we cannot meet the needs of our residents, then things can and must change.</p>",
    "q8":"Honestly providing opportunities for youth are some of the good calls the council has made in recent years. Body cameras in general were a good Idea. However, what has been missing has bee a solid plan to fund and maintain programs for our youth. The council continued to miss the mark with the myriad of failed opportunities to straighten our schools. Safety continues to be an issue that plagues the residents our city, and our council has made no gains. All of that would cause one to raise the question, if I am starting my family is Baltimore the City for me to raise my kids; Is Baltimore the city I should start my business; Is Baltimore the place I would allow my elderly parent live their years? I do not think the shout yes is nearly as loud and proud as it should be.</p>",
    "q9":"City services work well in many of the neighborhoods in the city. The system at its core is sound. However, there has to be consideration paid to persons who were victimized by persons abusing their power and position. The truth is as citizens we all deserve the highest quality service from city employees. Improvements to the system would be a matter of strategic planing of resources and and oversight. We would need to access where technology could streamline services without diminishing quality of communication. Additionally we would need to reassess the service performance evaluation system. Performance evaluations would need to play a growing roll in insuring residents are meeting adequate satisfaction levels.</p>",

    "q1":"The 11th District is extremely diverse and it's neighborhoods face a diverse set of challenges. Two universal issues are public safety and education.</p><p>I believe that one of the primary functions of our City government is to keep our residents safe. As Councilman, I will advocate for a community policing model and help to repair the relationship between officers and our residents. Community policing ensures officers know the frequent offenders in a community and it helps to develop trust with residents. I will also partner with local Police Community Relations Councils to create community-specific strategies and will advocate for more community relations officers. Lastly, I will demand that we accelerate the implementation of a Department-wide body camera program and that we focus our resources on targeting our most violent offenders. </p><p>Schools are the front-line in the fight to break the cycle of poverty that so many families in our city face. They are also the primary reason that young families choose to move out of the City. Our schools are underfunded and our facilities are under equipped to meet our children's needs. As Councilman, I will tirelessly lobby Annapolis to ensure that the Hogan administration adequately funds City schools. I will also advocate to ensure that the promises of the Construction and Revitalization Act are realized so that students and teachers can work in a healthy environment. Lastly, I'll partner with PTOs to leverage community resources under the Community Schools model and will fight to ensure accountability on North Avenue.</p>",
    "q2":"With 344 murders in 2015 I believe it is safe to say that Baltimore has a tremendous amount of work ahead to reduce violent crime. The current strategies are not effective and police-community relations have reached a tipping point. I believe that the current leadership within the Police Department is still unproven but is showing promising signs of improvement. </p><p>The 344 murders committed in Baltimore City last year were not committed by 344 different people. I am a strong believer that the Police Department should be doing more to target resources towards the City's most violent repeat offenders. I also believe that we could be doing more to use data and intelligence to target our minimal police resources.</p><p>I am a strong advocate for a community policing model. I believe that officers need to know the community that they are policing in order to be effective in keeping it safe. I will also partner with local Police Community Relations Councils to create community-specific strategies and will advocate for more community relations officers to ensure every community can communicate effectively with the Police Department. As Councilman I will fight to ensure that all officers receive adequate de-escalation and customer service training. I will also demand that we accelerate the implementation of a Department-wide body camera program.</p>",
    "q3":"The greatest lesson learned from the unrest following the death of Freddie Gray is that we will never make progress as a City until we address the general cycles of poverty and violence that exist in our low income communities. The disinvestment in those neighborhoods did not occur over night and will not be solved over night. We have reached our tipping point. We must provide a quality education to students in all neighborhoods. We must provide opportunities to young people that will set them on the path toward a stable career. We must address the vacant homes and severe blight and engage residents in rebuilding our communities. The unrest was a tragedy for our City in many ways but it is also an opportunity for us to refocus efforts to address the systemic issues that got us there.</p>",
    "q4":"It is imperative that Baltimore reduces its property tax rate in order to be more competitive with the surrounding counties. Family can move to the County and pay substantially less taxes, get more space, higher quality schools, and more responsive services. We must do better.</p><p>As an IT consultant working with government, I believe that there are substancial opportunities to use technology to streamline City processes, create efficiencies, and reduce costs. I also agree with proposals to create a separate trash collection fee that will put us on a more even playing field with the surrounding counties.</p><p>I do believe that financial incentives are one tool that can be effective in attracting investment in our City. It is extremely important that when we use this tool it needs to follow careful thought and calculation with the long-term economic health of our City as the primary concern. Given our disproportionate tax rate compared to surrounding jurisdictions it is often difficult to develop large-scale projects without some form of tax incentive. While Tax Increment Financing and Payment in Lieu of Taxes are the most common incentives, there have been some recent targeted tax credits that have shown great promise in providing a boost to economic development in Baltimore. Again, these tools should only be used after careful thought and consideration.</p>",
    "q5":"Baltimore City will never reach its full potential until we make significant investments in our low income communities. I have seen firsthand the devastating impact that vacant buildings can have on a community. This sort of blight perpetuates poverty and violence and stunts the growth of our City. I believe that the Vacants to Value program has fallen short and that we must do better. </p><p>As Councilman, I would work to enact stricter financial penalties for negligent owners and streamline the process for moving properties into the hands of responsible owners who are focused on rebuilding the community. I am a strong proponent of the Land Banking model being used by over 75 jurisdictions to efficiently handle acquisition, maintenance, and sale of vacant properties. Land Banks can be a valuable tool to both streamline the acquisition of dilapidated properties and to make investment more viable in low income communities. </p><p>The impact of Governor Hogan's initiative remains to be seen. The City and State's investment of approximately $165 million over the next four years toward demolition is a great start but will only yield results if leaders can effectively engage the community and the right partners to rebuild.</p>",
    "q6":"I believe that our City's image and our property tax rate are our chief barriers to economic development and job creation.</p><p>Whether we like it or not, property development is a business that is driven by profits. Baltimore's disproportionate tax rate compared to surrounding jurisdictions puts us at a competitive disadvantage when it comes to attracting investment. It is imperative that Baltimore reduces its property tax rate. I believe that there are substancial opportunities to use technology to streamline City processes, create efficiencies, and reduce costs in the City budget. I also agree with proposals to create a separate trash collection fee that will put us on a more even playing field with the surrounding counties.</p><p>Due to our high violent crime rate, Baltimore has always faced image issues. We suffered an additional blow with the unrest following the death of Freddie Gray. Companies and developers take this information into account when making decisions about where to make investments. I believe that elected leaders must be doing more to promote Baltimore and it's assets. </p>",
    "q7":"Baltimore City has one of the strongest Mayoral systems in the Country. In the last year, Mayor Rawlings-Blake has vetoed several bills passed by the City Council that were not able to meet the threshold to be overturned. The Mayor's power within the Board of Estimates essentially renders the body useless.</p><p>I believe that it is necessary for steps to be taken to reduce the power of the Mayor and restore checks and balances within City government. I support prior proposals by the Council reduce the size of the board of estimates and lower the threshold to overturn a Mayoral veto. I do not, however, believe that term limits are an effective means of limiting power for either branch. I believe that if an elected official has the support of the electorate then he or she should continue to serve. </p>",
    "q8":"Over the last four years, the Baltimore City Council has held hearings and even passed bills on many of the important issues facing our City. The important topics discussed include education, youth programming, public safety, property taxes, and the City budget. What we haven't seen is our Council move the needle on these issues and make a lasting impact that will improve the trajectory of our City.</p><p>Our Council members have not been effective advocates and have not done enough to create change. As Councilman, I will advocate tirelessly to address the system issues that our holding our City back. I will stand up to the Mayoral administration whenever necessary to ensure what is in the best interest of our citizens.</p>",
    "q9":"I believe that there is a severe lack of accountability within City agencies and an alarming lack of coordination between them. </p><p>Baltimore's Citistat program was considered a best practice that received international attention. It used data to ensure accountability within City Departments and the timely delivery of City services. The Citistat program has been neglected during the current administration and is no longer as effective as it once was. As Councilman, I will ensure that Citistat be strengthened and that it is used demand accountability and the efficient use of City resources.</p><p>I am also a strong believer in the use of technology to share data across agencies and ensure the coordination of services. Baltimore's 311 system, for example, is a valuable tool for tracking citizen requests for City services. The current system is limited and in need of replacement. A stronger system will result in greater accountability, faster response times, and better communication with residents.</p><p>I don't believe that a resident should have to visit 15 City Agencies in order to renovate their home or open a business. City government should be doing everything possible to encourage investment. This includes the consolidation of permitting processes as well as the ability to apply for permits online.</p>",
    "q10":"I've spent my career working on both the City and State levels to break the cycles of poverty and homelessness that have existed for generations. I am also currently the President of the Locust Point Civic Association. Given these experiences, I believe I bring a unique and balanced perspective to the challenges facing our City. I am a firm believer that the 11th District is the heartbeat of this City. If the 11th District, home to the majority of business and tourism, fails then Baltimore City fails. </p><p>I'm running for City Council because I believe that we can do better. We can find more creative ways to attract businesses to downtown, to ensure that streets are more walkable, that amenities that are more accessible, that our public schools are more competitive. We can do more to ensure that graduates of our many colleges and universities choose to live here and that our families stay here. We can have a Council Office that is more responsive to the needs of 11th District communities. I'm passionate about this City and this District and I'm ready to be the next Councilman in the 11th.</p>"

I would work with State and Federal government to review the programs available under the Community Reinvestment Act to see if they are actually performing sufficiently to developed low income and depressed areas. Additionally, I would work to certify a Community Development Financial Institution option for city low income neighborhoods.</p><p>Public safety is a concern throughout the city. If elected I will develop a strong relationship with the Chief of Police and the precinct commanders in my district. I am convinced through more listening and cooperation, citizens and the Baltimore City police department can successfully come together to improve public safety.</p><p>Given that McCulloh Homes is in my district and the issues there have been well noted, it's clear that obtaining safe, quality, and affordable housing is a struggle. I would support affordable housing policies to assist the neediest families in securing safe and affordable housing. If elected, I would look to sit on the Committee with jurisdiction over public and low income housing. From this post I would develop relations with the Housing Authority Commissioner and senior managers to stay abreast of the critical issues confronting families and city service providers. Additionally, I would prioritize single mothers with children, homeless families and moving people from transitional living arrangements to permanent homes. Finally, I would look to make sure related city service providers are coordinating other matters (job search, training, child care, school feeding) to help stabilize families.</p>",
    "q2":"First, I do not believe Chief Davis has been on seat long enough to evaluate whether or not his strategy is correct or not. Yes, thus far I do have confidence in the current leadership at the Police Department. Two communities in Prince George's County, Hillcrest Heights and Fairmount Heights have demonstrated persistent community organization and dedication police leadership can reduce overall crime.</p><p>Again, if elected, I will regularly engage the police and introduce the Chief of Police to local leaders to discuss the issues and identify beginning and intermediate strategies to build confidence and work together. Overall, the goal should be to target violent crime, then work to drive down overall crime statistics. This approach can and must work.</p>",
    "q3":"1) There needs to be better command and control, training and inter-agency coordination between the City's emergency response/public notification apparatus </p><p>2) State and City leaders must have better protocols for increasing security during public unrest</p><p>3) Police patrol and arrest procedures should be reviewed to better determine \"probable cause\" for arrests </p><p>4) Rough wagon rides should be abolished and seat belt use on suspects should be mandatory. </p><p>5) The city should review regular police and community liaison forums to work together to identify priority areas for crime prevention action.</p>",
    "q4":"Baltimore should reduce property taxes because the current rate is too high to attract economic investment in lower income areas and it scares off business investment. I like portions of Councilman Mosby's property tax reduction plan that seeks to charge a higher tax rate for vacant properties and dedicating some proceeds from increased assessments to reducing the tax rate.</p><p>Tax increment financing (TIF), payments in lieu of taxes and other incentives are useful and have proven to be successful. However, my primary concerns are the unintended consequences of such schemes. I would want to make sure that persons living in low income areas are still able to afford to live in their own neighborhoods and not driven out by gentrification. My vision is for Baltimore City to be an inclusive and prosperous city.</p>",
    "q5":"Baltimore must work with the institutional anchors that exist in blighted areas to first identify what type of development make sense for the neighborhood. This means consultations to form a working coalition of business leaders, civic groups, ecumenical leaders, elected official and city government to create a plan to attract investment and development.</p><p>Vacants to Value is a good concept, but again it has unintended consequences of pricing low income people out of their neighborhoods. This is problematic. If elected, I would look to see how we could tweak the program to allow people to remain and still uplift the neighborhood. Governor Hogan's plan to combat blight is a good effort and should help the city address blight and vacant houses. It is a welcome idea that I am glad city leaders endorsed.</p>",
    "q6":"There are several barriers to economic development. First, the Federal government has almost withdrawn from major inner cities. In the 1970's and 1980's the Federal government supported private led development of areas such as the Inner Harbor and Charles Center. Today, however, participation at past levels is difficult to come by. Additionally, many minority businesses lack access to capital and still do not receive a sufficient share of Federal and State contracting dollars. Credit and financial literacy training also limit many small minority businesses that hire people from the community. An increase in the quality of education in the Baltimore School System is a must. Too many students are graduating without the basic skills needed to be prepared for the workforce. Finally, worker training and counseling for older workers is also a must. There is very little discussion on how to better assist out of work people over 50.</p>",
    "q7":"The balance of power between the Mayor and the City Council favors the Mayor. While the Mayoralty here is strong, the Council does have strength in numbers. If anything, I would change the voting ratio to override a veto from three quarters to three-fifths. Also, I would look to reduce the Mayors control over the votes on the Board of Estimates.</p>",
    "q8":"The Council has not always focused on the right issues. At times there have been balance of power squabbles with the Mayor. I believe some of the public safety issues like mandating body cameras for police have been very important. Attempts to address the City's fiscal woes, pension reform, and fire house closures remain very important.</p>",
    "q9":"Baltimore is challenged by a lack of financial resources, many low income communities and an increased demand for basic social services following the 2008 financial crisis. I believe the city must do the best it can to upgrade technology and create public-private partnerships to fill some of the gaps. Additionally, better education and professional training of city workers would go a long way to improve resident satisfaction.</p>",
    "q10":"As far back as I can remember, both my Grandfather and Father told countless stories of how they left the South with little education and made a good life here in Baltimore. For me, Baltimore has always meant family, opportunity and home. It is my desire to make sure the city remains a place where hometown people can grow and prosper and new residents can find hope and inspiration like my Grandfather and Father. I believe their story of hope is alive and well in Baltimore City.</p>"

    "q1":"Baltimore's civic leaders have long tried to tackle long-term systemic problems with short-term, patchwork solutions. That said, there are some issues that can be addressed immediately, and that will help us toward our long-term goals:</p><p>1. Schools and Youth: We need to be smart about the resources we invest in our young people. We need high-quality programs for young people, not just new rec centers; </p><p>2. The over concentration of substance abuse clinics and social services in the 12th District: While I recognize the need for these services, it is wrong and counterproductive to concentrate services for the entire region in just a few neighborhoods. We need a regional strategy to stop the ghettoization of these services;</p><p>3. The poor state of public spaces in the 12th District: A great city is defined by the greatness of its public spaces. Many of the spaces that could be uplifting urban amenities in Baltimore are instead paved over surface parking, or litter-strewn lots. We need to create and maintain public spaces in a way that reflects our ambitions for our city.</p><p>4. A lack of basic city services: Pedestrian street lighting and ample public trash cans and pickup are all but absent in large swaths of the 12th. Every neighborhood in Baltimore deserves the basics.</p><p>5. Poor transit and connectivity: too many neighborhoods in the 12th District are isolated We need prioritize public transit, tame vehicular traffic on the district's major thoroughfares, and create seamless connections among all our neighborhoods. </p>",
    "q2":"The police exist to protect and serve the citizens of Baltimore. Each and every one. We need to ensure that police are fair and equitable in the application of justice. We need more police who live in our city, and who understand the nuances and rhythms of city life.</p><p>That said, serious crime is a real problem in Baltimore. I've myself been a victim. And when serious crime occurs, police need the resources and respect to address it.</p><p>However, one of our problems in Baltimore is our knee-jerk reaction of seeing police as the solution to crime. When you use police as the one-size-fits-all answer to urban ills, you necessarily invite strained relations and abuse.</p><p>We need to:</p><p>1. Recognize the power of clean neighborhoods, streetscaping, and pedestrian-friendly environments in restoring civility to our public areas and showing our youth that we respect them, and that they, in turn, should respect each other; </p><p>2. Get police out of their cars. Police need to walk the neighborhoods they serve.</p><p>3. Keep police assigned to neighborhoods long-term. Cycling different officers through neighborhoods every few months does little to build trust from the community or familiarity for the officer; </p><p>4. Establish a municipal police force. We need a level of enforcement between 311 and 911. An unarmed, lower cost force to deal with minor crimes and violations can help us address the quality of life issues that deter new residents from moving into Baltimore, while allowing our police to focus on serious crime.</p>",
    "q3":"That the people of this city are tired of being ignored. A trip down North Avenue shows the utter failure of Baltimore's political and business establishment over the last 40 years. The current state of much of the city is beyond shameful, and the protests and unrest were testament to this.</p>",
    "q4":"Smart development is crucial to Baltimore's future. In my own neighborhood, I've seen developers work with communities to execute first-rate projects.</p><p>While I think that lowering property taxes is important, I also recognize that this alone will not bring in the investment our city needs. More important than the simple dollar amount of property taxes paid is the value proposition: are property owners getting something in return for what they pay? Right now, in many parts of the city, they aren't.</p><p>I'm not opposed to all uses of TIFs and PILOTs. In some (extremely limited) contexts, these can make sense. What I am absolutely opposed to is using these programs for private gain at public expense. For any development in which the city is engaged, we need to ensure that Baltimore--as a whole--is the beneficiary, not just the developer involved.</p>",
    "q5":"To revitalize our neighborhoods, we must first recognize our strengths. We have gorgeous architecture and an amazing cultural life that cities the world over would envy. Protecting and cherishing these must be the foundation of any strategy we pursue.</p><p>Our neighborhoods must be reconnected. The high-speed thoroughfares that slice and dice our city north, south, east, and west must be reimagined. The JFX; Greenmount Avenue; St. Paul Street; Calvert Street; Harford Road; Preston Street; North Avenue. We have taken parts of our city that should connect our communities, and turned them into places of division. The virtual highways of Pratt Street and Lombard Street prevent the needed connections between the prosperity of the waterfront and the rest of Baltimore. It's time we take simple steps to correct this.</p><p>Regarding \"blight\": I believe the efforts to tear down historic Baltimore are short-sighted and misguided. A vacant, abandoned building is not the problem. In cities around the world, buildings as dilapidated as those in this city are consistently restored. And in Baltimore, we have plenty of neighborhoods in which widespread demolition has done little to improve local conditions. Rather than foolheartedly attempting to demolish our way to prosperity, we need to embrace the uniqueness of Baltimore's urban fabric. As a city councilman, I will personally travel around the country and world to find the people and businesses to repopulate our empty neighborhoods.</p>",
    "q6":"Fundamentally, Baltimore has lost its vision. It's lost its ability to believe in itself. When, for example, a big-box strip mall is touted as a vital economic development and job creation opportunity for the center of a major 21st century North American city--\"Houston, we have a problem.\" Our residents deserve high-paying, meaningful employment. </p><p>First, and foremost, we must appreciate and leverage the incredible assets we have in Baltimore. And we must market those assets not just to our local region, but to the world. Baltimore is a world-class city, and we must remember that. Baltimore is a place that takes care of its own, but also attracts talent from everywhere. The financial capital we need to bring jobs and restore our city exists all over. We just need to go get it. A few things I intend to pursue:</p><p>1. Offset programs for large-scale, capital-intensive projects: As we do things like build out our transportation system or overhaul infrastructure, we should work with suppliers who commit to permanently bringing a portion of their manufacturing or supply operations to Baltimore; </p><p>2. Taxation: We need a graduated property tax system that's simple and fair. One that encourages investment but discourages negligence and speculation; </p><p>3. Consistency in application: We need a climate in which small businesses feel that they are being treated in a predictable and fair manner. From the planning department to inspectors, the city needs to take the guesswork out of investing here.</p>",
    "q7":"The City Council must be smart and creative in asserting its inherent authority. But to do this, the Council needs to be filled with those smart, creative people. It needs people willing to stand up to the mayor when necessary. </p><p>Under our current model, the mayor can offer or withhold basic constituent services to certain districts in order to reward or punish certain city council people. This is wrong, and absolutely must change.</p><p>It is the job of City Council to be an effective counterweight to the mayor. I would see to it that Baltimore's legislative body is not a mere rubber stamp for the chief executive's priorities.</p>",
    "q8":"I struggle to answer this question. I have seen the City Council focused largely on symptoms, not root causes. </p><p>As a recent example, I've seen great consternation within City Council about the lack of recreation centers. And while I agree that recreation centers serve an important role, I also recognize that, alone, they're not a solution. We need programming for young people. We need new residents and jobs. We need a viable economy. While building a new center may make us all feel better in the moment, the truth is, this alone won't have advanced the ball for our young people. They need jobs and opportunities in the long-term.</p><p>I haven't seen the Council taking on complex issues that will lead to growth in our city. Issues like changing our tax code; preserving our heritage; incentivizing high-quality investment to locate here.</p><p>Perhaps most important, I haven't seen individual city council people be the the ambassadors Baltimore desperately needs to bring resources back home.</p>",
    "q9":"Baltimore--and the 12th District, in particular--suffers from an incredibly inequitable delivery of city services. The quality and availability of city services should not depend on whether a city council member is your neighbor. It should not depend on whether you live in a special benefits district.</p><p>We need to find ways to ensure that all neighborhoods have equal access to and delivery of City services.</p><p>Baltimore deserves more, and more responsive, service. Further, ours should not be a complaint-driven system. There should be inspectors in every part of the city noting and proactively dealing with problems before residents complain. Complaints should be rare, not the norm.</p>",
    "q10":"I'm running for office because it's time for Baltimore to once again be a place that creates wealth and prosperity for all its residents. The 12th District, lying at the center of City, should be an economic engine of Baltimore--not a drive-through area with neighborhoods emptying out. I'm running because it's critical we reconnect the neighborhoods at the heart of Baltimore into something that serves to uplift the people who call those neighborhoods home. To do this requires vision and commitment, two qualities I've seen woefully lacking in City Hall and city government.</p>"

There are many individuals in the 12th district who are trying to rebuild there lives, and looking for an opportunity to do so. I believe that taking the time to really reach out and provide resources to these community members can make a huge impact. But it is not about just providing the resources, but creating a system in order to train them for jobs/careers that can sustain a living wage and provide for families. Doing so can and will cut down crime rates because we will be providing individuals with options and real life opportunities to actually work, and not just go through training programs after program with no positive end result.</p><p>The 12th district has so much potential for economic development. Our position within the city puts us central to many key transportation points, developing communities and areas. Working to bring more small businesses to the area is going to be a benefit for many.

I think that it is too early to put full confidence in the current leader but I do believe he understands the importance of community inclusion and has made it apparent that he is open to new and progressive strategies.</p><p>One thing I would do to strengthen and improve community relations with the police department is to expose youth to more positive interactions with law enforcement at an early age. Advocate and push for officers to begin interacting with our youth as young as the elementary school level in order to instill and allow our youth to be able to balance those possible negative interactions with law enforcement with positive experiences.</p>",
    "q3":"I learned that being proactive is essential. Much of the controversy surrounding Mr. Gray has been going on in the city of Baltimore for decades. In order to make positive changes, save lives, and protect communities, individuals, agencies, and leadership must be held accountable for not serving in a preventative capacity but more of a reactive. Serving in this way will only lead to greater problems in this city.</p>",
    "q4":"It is important to attract developers to the city in order for it to grow. It is also just as important for individuals to be able to afford to live and buy homes in Baltimore without feeling like they need to move to experience the ease of tax rates in other areas.</p><p>Many of our current residents suffer from the rates that we pay now in part due to the millions that are not being paid by many owners of these vacant homes. We really have to evaluate at this point which we would rather have, lower taxes or a cut in city services. We can't lower how the city funds itself and not find another means to supplement those costs. ie. all the vacant homes that are not currently paying property taxes.</p>",
    "q5":"I believe Baltimore should invite the community to be more involved in development processes. Baltimore has many unused industrial, and commercial spaces that can be utilized much more efficiently. Many residents know what they want and need to see in their community and should be given the opportunity to display that.</p><p>Baltimore has to market better all the great things that the city has to offer, and \"sell\" the uniqueness of each community.</p><p>I would like to know the comprehensive plan of Governor Hogan other than demolishing neighborhoods and adding green spaces. When these spaces are opened up and alley ways exposed, is there a plan for trash and dumping?</p><p>Yes it may benefit neighborhoods visually, but their are so many more variables to our communities than vacant homes. I think a comprehensive and holistic plan needs to be shared from job opportunities to green space use.</p>",
    "q6":"One of the major chief barriers is the rate of taxes in Baltimore City. It is hard to attract companies and corporations to this city when everywhere surrounding is more economically reasonable to establish their business. </p><p>I would work with my constituents to find ways to lower taxes, and also create incentives for business that benefit both parties.</p>",
    "q7":"No I don't believe there is a balance of power. It is well known the mayor holds the power.</p><p>I do think it is priority for the mayor and the city council to work together, but I do not feel that it is fair to encourage councilman to feel obligated to support majority mayoral initiatives.</p><p>As a new city council person I will introduce new legislation to amend the city charter so that all the power does not fall upon the mayoral position.</p>",
    "q8":"No the city council has not been focused on the right issues. City Council has given little attention to education, public safety, and the youth of our city.</p><p>I think that one of the most important and missed opportunities to make a major difference during this term ,was the legislation passed for auditing. I commend those individuals who fought for stricter auditing regulations for our city agencies. I think that transparency and accountability is essential if we are going to restore trust and move this city forward.</p>",
    "q9":"The communication portals and channels are outdated and inefficient. The community receives delayed information, if it is received at all.</p><p>For example the city council website has not posted minutes from their meetings since last February. Many residents can not and do not attend their meetings and could utilize on line services to stay abreast of what is happening at City Hall.</p><p>Bringing back 2 day a week sanitation services, will definitely please residents as it will cut down on trash in our streets as well as rodent issues.</p>",
    "q10":"I am running for office to inspire others, especially my generation to be apart of the political process. To be an example of what leader should be and exemplify. I am running to be the next City Councilman of the 12th district in order to bring the position back to the community and represent this diverse district with full inclusion.</p>"

Housing: Homes are a platform for opportunity. ­ if you have a job ­ you have a home. I will fight to make it easier for people to own homes.</p><p>3. A Stronger Community: By re-building accountability and respect between our neighbors, businesses and the police</p>",
    "q2":"As the next Councilman for the 12th district, I will make sure that residents can walk down the streets safely. The murder rate in Baltimore is unconscionable. We must find new ways to protect the people of Baltimore. I will require continuous improvement and training surrounding conflict resolution for officers, finding new ways to resolve problems instead of just locking people up. This training should be a training that must be completed once if not twice a year. Crime should be dealt with accordingly but at the same time, singling people out will not be tolerated. We must empower officers to find better solutions for making a better baltimore. </p>",
    "q3":"The death of Freddie Grey was horrific. Despite reassurances from law enforcement the struggle still continues. Institutional racism is still alive and well, sadly. It is time we work together to rebuild the trust between police and the community. No one deserves to be treated like a second class citizen. The lesson from this is that It taught us the importance of holding police accountable. There must be more training for officers or re-training as the case may be. In addition, there needs to be not only a state of the art GPS system that tracks the speed, condition of the roads and how the driver is operating a transport vehicle, but there also needs to be recording devices in the back of the vehicle to protect not only the transporter but the person being transported. </p>",
    "q4":"Yes Baltimore needs to make owning a home a reality for those who have full time jobs! My view on the use of tax increment financing is that is it should provide a return to the community or city greater than the loss in revenue.</p>",
    "q5":"We need to make it easier for small business to open shop away from the waterfront. We can't continue to ignore the rest of the city just because it doesn't bring in as much revenue for the state. I evaluate Vacants To Value by how good of a program it will be for Baltimore but let's be clear, this is only the tip of the iceberg. We need to ensure that those who want to open up shop in Baltimore, regardless of the location, are not discouraged in doing so by over-regulating. If we want to grow our local economy, this is how we do it. tearing down buildings is only part of it. What we do after that is what will make the difference between long term economic growth, or short term economic growth. We can't simply just hand it over to developer's without making sure that first and foremost, the people benefit from it more than if there were a small grocery store, or corner store. I applaud Gov. Hogan with his proposal, but it's only the first step. </p>",
    "q6":"Economic growth is hindered because Baltimore is not open for business and small businesses choose the county to open up shop. We need to make our district's vibrant to attract more small business owners. My plan is to ensure that if you want a job -you have a job with good wages. When a small business opens shop they must not be closed down by city bureaucracy. In the first year costs are important to keep under control. Apprenticeships from high school and local schools can work hand in hand to solve these issues. This plan makes great economic sense and I will work to implement it on day one.</p>",
    "q7":"This is an acceptable balance of power. With that said, City Council has not used their existing powers to keep the executive branch in check. We must ensure that we get the corruption and back-room deals out of it our local politics! The people are tired of the shady deals and handing off positions to people without the voters getting a say. Furthermore, as much as this works, we can always and should always look to find ways to improve how it functions for the people of Baltimore.</p>",
    "q8":"The city council has failed to use common sense in most of its actions for as long as I've lived in Baltimore. Most recently, we've seen the council fail to do even the simplest of tasks to hold the city and the Mayor, along with her administration to the high standards that the people have here.To say that they've not used their power to hold the the city accountable, is an understatement. The council have told the people what is important instead of asking our opinions. The votes on the council have focused on support for the few while ignoring the voices of the majority; all while we hear horror stories surrounding housing repairs, transportation failures and accountability to the people is an afterthought.</p>",
    "q9":"From transportation reliability, to cleaner streets to ending the back room deals and corruption, it is time we clean up our city's politics. It is time for a change. The people of baltimore deserve to be able to walk down the street safely, have clean streets and better lit ones too. They deserve to not have to catch three buses just to get across town. They deserve to have a choice in not just who they vote for but who they choose to deliver digital services.</p>",
    "q10":"I am running for office to make a Batter Baltimore, a livable Baltimore. I am running to bring Better Paying jobs and wages. I am running to bring Better Housing opportunities for all and just as important, I am running to create a Better Community, holding the city accountable, and being a councilman who will work every day on re-building the respect, trust, and accountability between our neighbors, businesses and police.</p>"

    "q1":"The most pressing issues in District 12 also exist city-wide. Our politicians are selling us out. When a big, rich, multinational company calls up city hall our leaders roll out the red carpet. They offer huge tax breaks, free or reduced land, and quickly cut through all the red tape that the rest of us have to deal with.</p><p>When I, Ian Schlakman, am your Baltimore City Councilor, I will make it clear to the developers and to big business that Baltimore and it's people are not for sale to the highest bidder. </p><p>The City's strategy of investing in large-scale development projects for elite businesses needs to stop. We can trace these developments from the downtown Hilton to the Grand Prix to the Exelon tower in Harbor East, and through the expansion of Johns Hopkins into neighborhoods that haven't been best served by any of these projects. These projects and dozens more were funded instead of the Red Line, better bus routes, homeless shelters, parks, rec centers, quality schools, and much more. </p><p>Most Baltimore residents would cite crime, education, and failing city infrastructure as the most pressing issues in their district, and they are right. We can improve all of these by drawing the line on city investment in private projects and the loss of future tax funding because of TIFs and other tax breaks. With funds to invest in world-class schools, modern transit, infrastructure and neighborhood development, we can change the way Baltimoreans live, travel, and thrive.</p>",
    "q2":"No amount of investment in new police officers, training or equipment can reduce violent crime. Spending on these police tools can change the police department's response to violent crime, but it does nothing to prevent violent crime from happening in the first place. The police department must make it clear to the City Council that only a massive investment in communities can prevent the conditions that cause violent crime. One of the reasons people turn to violent crime is because they have no viable access to jobs and are then unable to provide for their family.</p><p>Community / police relations will improve when city residents no longer have to turn to criminal activities to support themselves and their families. The City Council must work to legalize and regulate the sale of marijuana, and cut off funding the failed War on Drugs. They must find ways to decrease the 50% of young, black men who are either in jail or under the supervision of the criminal justice system, making it difficult to find employment. The City Council needs to work with private employers to provide incentives for hiring ex-felons. They also need to work to fund a massive public works project designed to rebuild our city's crumbling infrastructure with the help of every worker unable to find a job in the city.</p>",
    "q3":"Anyone currently in city government who didn't see the riots and looting coming needs to be held responsible. Anyone in office who knew how bad things were out there but did nothing to improve the situation should be voted out. Our city government has failed our city's youth.</p><p>Activists, advocacy groups, young people, and those that mentor our young people have been telling us for years that our city's children are in deep trouble. The rate of unemployment in young African American communities is near 50%. Every year when the city puts on it's annual summer jobs program the line to join stretches for blocks.</p><p>Community control of police forces is vital to peace. Neighborhoods know which police officers have a history of violence and aggression in the area. Communities need to have the authority to remove these officers from those neighborhoods. The city's Civilian Review Board needs to have the authority to impose discipline on officers who have shown a history of violence. The police department overall needs to be less militarized and show a more appropriate response to minor incidents.</p>",
    "q4":"Most families taxes in Baltimore are incredibly high. And there's a simple explanation for it: Wealthy corporations get all the tax breaks. To make up for all the lost revenue working families and small businesses have to pay more.</p><p>I am the anti-corporate tax break candidate. No more tax breaks for rich out-of-state businesses who use Baltimore as a source of cheap labor. If you're an out-of-state business that wants to come into Baltimore you need to pay your fair share of taxes and you need to pay the people here a decent wage of at least $15 per hour.</p><p>Tax breaks, such as Tax Increment Funding (TIF), Payments in Lieu of Taxes (PILOT) and other incentives to encourage development are the core of Baltimore's inability to invest in basic needs like quality schools, roads, public transportation, and social services. The loss of future tax income when we give out these tax breaks prevents Baltimore from investing in larger-scale community development projects such as municipal homeless shelters, public hospitals, a city-wide basic income guarantee, and a free college education at city institutions. </p><p>The city can raise all local taxes without community backlash if it can show that increased tax revenue is being spent on the people's needs for basic and advanced city services, rather than on massive, private development projects.</p>",
    "q5":"Why don't we house every homeless family in Baltimore? We obviously have a surplus of housing. It's the right thing too, of course. The answer is simple: there's no money to be made in housing them.</p><p>That's why I will be kind of leader that always does what's right, not just what's profitable. We need the political will to take care of all of our residents in Baltimore, not just the ones who are rich.</p><p>Thousands of Baltimoreans experience homelessness on a daily basis. Providing housing can give many of these city residents the chance they need to get off the streets. Institute a program to train city residents in renovating city-owned vacant properties and use them to provide housing for people in need of a place to live. Many cities, including large ones like Salt Lake City, have found success with this model.</p><p>Once enough housing has been found to house everyone in need, the Vacants to Value program should be expanded to allow everyone who wants to own and invest in a home to do so. Access to quality housing should be considered a human right and shared city resource, and it should be as inexpensive as possible for everyone to take advantage of. </p><p>The City should treat its housing stock as a precious resource. Vacant houses should be demolished only as a last resort when rehabilitation isn't an option. Demolishing homes to create new open space for sale to developers is another unnecessary handout to corporate developers.</p>",
    "q6":"My wife and I own a small business fixing computers for schools in the inner city. I also consult with people looking to open up their own small business in the city.</p><p>If you're a big business from out-of-state the city will roll out the red carpet with tax breaks, land giveaways and help with the red tape. The rest of us have to pay tons of taxes, pay high rents for office space and wait in endless lines for permits.</p><p>We need to make it easier for locals to open up small businesses in the city. We also need to teach vocational skills in and out of our school system. This means a young adult fresh out of high school or college will have a much easier time starting their own business with a vocational skill that can help their community.</p><p>I'm proposing that our city took a look at new creative options for developing the local economy. This includes worker cooperatives, more co-working spaces, small business incubators, urban farms and complete streets that promote more pedestrians and cyclists.</p><p>Recently the United Workers gave a presentation at University of Maryland School of Social Work about Community Land Trusts. They produced a white paper that spells out exactly how to help communities increase home ownership for our lower income residents. We need city councilors that applaud, listen, and help when our citizens tell us how to improve their neighborhoods. That's the kind of councilperson I intend to be.</p>",
    "q7":"Our mayor has far too much power. When there's an emergency such as a snow storm, hurricane or riot, we need to exclusively rely on a mayor who wasn't elected to handle such tragic situations.</p><p>The mayor also directly controls nearly every department in the city. That means a mayor who knows nothing about how to deal with crime and homelessness is still in charge of both of those departments.</p><p>This model, known as the strong mayor model, is an incredibly outdated decades old way of running a city. We need to modernize this and do away with the strong mayor model. There needs to be far more collaboration with the city council and community input when it comes to appointing department heads that run the city. </p><p>Certain departments, such as the dept of city planning need far more independence while other departments, such as the police, need far more community input.</p><p>We absolutely need an elected school board. Concerned parents and kids often find themselves going to school board meetings and leaving in sheer frustration. I know I've stood shoulder to shoulder with teachers, parents, and students protesting more stricter testing, crumbling school buildings and school leadership that doesn't listen to the community.</p><p>An elected school board would mean that teachers and parents can do more than just protest. They can start organizing as they rally their community to get them on the school board and directly fix the problems. Anything less than an elected school board is anti-democratic.</p>",
    "q8":"I will focus on getting immediate help to families that work full time but are still struggling to make it. I will do this by proposing a $15 an hour minimum wage bill tied to inflation. I've already been working on this issue as an activist and I know exactly who else we'd need to push on the council to get this passed.</p><p>I will focus on ending the monopolies that are financially crippling us. This means I will work to end the cities exclusive agreements with Comcast so that we can have more TV and Internet providers. </p><p>I will create an alternative to BGE in the form of a city wide power coop where our citizens will be installing solar panels and wind turbines right in the city. This will create new green jobs for people, help our environment and slash your utility bills.</p><p>I will also be the anti-corporate tax break candidate. The City Council needs to draw a line in the sand - not one more TIF, PILOT or tax break for a company looking to do business at Baltimore's expense. The City Council needs to focus its energies solely on investing in a major public works project to allow Baltimoreans to work and rebuild our transit, health, education, and safety infrastructure.</p>",
    "q9":"It was here in District 12 where 26th street collapsed. For years the residents complained about the condition of the street, the sidewalk, and the retaining wall that eventually collapsed. The city didn't want to deal with it simply because it wasn't something that could be easily fixed.</p><p>We need to improve our infrastructure city-wide, but especially in District 12 as we have many rail lines and are a transit corridor for the rest of the city.</p><p>Our city needs more investment. I am the only candidate in the race who regularly talks to our city planners and regularly looks at other cities around the world for the most creative and modern methods to make sure our infrastructure is up-to-date and benefits everyone in Baltimore, not just the wealthy.</p><p>The City needs to invest in a massive public works project to rebuild and improve our infrastructure in transit, water, sewer, electricity, schools, and more. By giving jobs to Baltimoreans, we can build a world-class school, and transit system. We can provide free or low-cost, city-wide high speed internet and build a system of parks and green spaces to improve the health and well-being of all city residents. We can provide housing for all and develop public hospitals to provide quality medical care for all. Once we see Baltimore as a resource that all of us have the right to use instead of a space for businesses to scoop up and re-sell at premium rates, Baltimore residents will truly be satisfied.</p>",
    "q10":"I'm running becuase we need a city councilor that will put people before profits!</p><p>Every month our city finds new ways to give more city services to multi-national corporations. That puts the concerned citizen in a state of constantly fighting against water privatization, bus services being privatized, polluting incinerators being built right next to schools, etc...</p><p>Enough is Enough! We need a leader in city hall who will lead the fight against these giveaways and put people before profits.</p><p>I am the one candidate in this race that will consistently fight against give aways to large corporations. I will never pander to corporate interests.</p><p>I have a vision for a Baltimore in which the City Council prioritizes the needs of people - the right to fair wages, quality housing, health care and income security - first. </p><p>And I have a plan for winning a $15/hour minimum wage, stopping all corporate tax give aways, ending the monopolies of BGE and Comcast, and immediately housing the city's homeless population. All it takes is the recognition that the people of Baltimore - not the corporations of Baltimore - are what matter.</p>"

    "q1":"Two of the most important issues that we face in District 12 are safety and education, which I believe to be linked. Maintaining safety will be one of my highest priorities as Councilman. Disparities in education often are the root of much of the crime we face as citizens of District 12. I intend to modernize our educational system and utilize incentives to accelerate academic performance. This enhanced educational system will create the foundation for responsible citizens that do not entertain the path of crime. Everyone wants safe neighborhoods and good schools. That is what will attract new families to our neighborhoods.</p>",
    "q2":"First and foremost I must thank the officers of Baltimore City's Police Department for their service. The difficulties they face on a daily basis take great courage. That being said many officers feel their hands are tied when it comes to policing. Faith must be restored in our fine officers. Higher standards must be upheld and a sweeping audit of performance testing must be done. A strict regimen of testing, training, and continuing education is necessary to uphold the laws highest standards.</p>",
    "q3":"The entirety of our great nation is still learning lessons from this tragic incident. The reflections of our history predict a bleak future filled with prison, drugs, and violence unless addressed immediately. The war on drugs has become a war on the people of Baltimore. The power drugs have on the citizens of Baltimore must be undermined and diminished. We must work together to resolve the issue of poor education so children can make the important life changing decisions they face in this tough city every day. Each child that is empowered to find and develop his or her strengths will make our citizens and our city stronger and more prosperous.</p>",
    "q4":"Taxes must be reduced in the city to encourage growth in both the business sectors. We must encourage businesses to move to Baltimore and employ our citizens. We also need to encourage people to move into our city neighborhoods. Too often we talk about people getting out of their neighborhoods to achieve a better life when we should be making programs to entice people to move back into the city and live side by side with the current residents. Let a person keep the low taxes of his neighbors even if he fixes up his house. I will promote the dollar homes program my mother took advantage of when I was a child. Homes under this program were sold by the city for a dollar if the owner invested money to fix it up and live in it. I will promote low tax or tax free zones in decaying neighborhoods to encourage growth and restoration. I will push for a \"use it or lose it\" tax that forces property owners to pay increasing taxes for vacant property. This policy would prevent the spread of vacant housing and encourage owners of vacant properties to find solutions to make their property useful. The hard working people of our city should not be paying for those who do not attempt to improve it. We need to build strong communities. That can't be done if people flee to lower tax rates outside the city.</p>",
    "q5":"I commend Governor Hogan for his efforts. The revitalization of the east and west sides of Baltimore is paramount to the overall health of our city. We need to do more! The people need to pour into the neighborhoods that have been crippled by blight and assess what properties can be salvaged. Then work with the city and philanthropic institutions to endow these homes to families that will repair and take root in these new communities. It is an exciting time, the great house rush of Baltimore is upon us and those who get involved will discover the opportunities for prosperity that accompanies good housing and good neighbors. While families that come from a tradition of homeownership are knowledgeable about the process of buying and maintaining a home, most of our inner city youth do not have access to this knowledge. I will promote classes in homeownership in our city middle and high schools. The Greater Baltimore Board of Realtors would be a great resource for educating our young people on how to purchase a home.</p>",
    "q6":"The main barrier is the lack of skills our educational system has provided to the majority of its residents. Many jobs in Baltimore require more training for their employees than public schools provide. In particular, we need to increase the focus on trade schools that teach the skills for development, repair and maintenance of housing. We have over ten thousand homes that need servicing and an entire educational program should be developed to address this issue. Once our communities are repaired, small businesses, shops, and services will follow. Our neighborhoods should be allowed to have small storefronts for services that would benefit the community.</p>",
    "q7":"The power of the Mayor should be respected. As Councilman of District 12 my focus will be on my district. The districts are too large, the neighborhoods are divided, the City Council members are too few, and they are paid too much. I believe there should to be more members of City Council and district lines should not be drawn through the middle of neighborhoods. As a Councilman I am dedicated to serving my district. I vow to spend all money earned from my position in my district. I also believe that a City Council member should not run for higher office until the problems of their district have been resolved. That is why I promise never to run for higher office until the job is done in District 12.</p>",
    "q8":"Well something is not working. The City is back to the sad shape it was when I was a boy. Focused or not, the job is not getting done. I'm glad we have development by the water and people are moving in but most of my districts issues have not been addressed. I have created innovative and fun sanitation solutions that are cost effective. Improving the cleanliness of the City will encourage appreciation and preservation. The council is simply not engaging the community. We are great people that are waiting for inspiration and leadership. It is time we fulfill the promise of prosperity that so many have spoken of. Having a strong leader like myself on the City Council will generate the results the citizens want.</p>",
    "q9":"Since I was a boy I never bothered calling the City for anything. It takes forever and there is no accountability. I propose every transaction with any City employee generate a receipt that can be commented on and reviewed if necessary. We have to hold the stewards of our city accountable. If business can do it, so can we.</p>",
    "q10":"I was born and raised in Baltimore. As a citizen I have an obligation to make our city the greatest city in America! I have studied and worked extremely hard to understand Baltimore's issues and develop solutions. Now is the time to accomplish Baltimore's great revival. It's Baltimore's Time! I love living in Baltimore City and want to make others feel the same way.</p>"

    "q1":"1. Jobs. Many unemployed and under-employed residents lack the appropriate training and skills necessary to take advantage of the few jobs that do become available. Baltimore City must look beyond temporary fixes and attract companies in emerging markets. Only then, will the time spent on job training benefit our residents in the long-term and increase their potential to earn living wages for their families.</P><p>2. Economic opportunity and local businesses are lacking in our neighborhoods. I support efforts that involve bringing the City, the community and developers together to create a comprehensive plan to address the absence of commercial enterprises and that would encourage growth.</P><p>3. Education has been on the back burner far too long. Allocate a larger portion of the City budget to fund after school enrichment programs, hire more teachers (who are subject matter experts), hire social workers who can address the root causes of what prevents our kids from learning, and fund parent workshops to help parents/guardians learn how to be the best advocates for their children.</P><p>4. Public safety is a major issue that cannot be ignored. Safer streets come about with true community based policing. I would push for improved officer training and increased police-community relations as a starting point. Rebuilding the public trust and solving crimes go hand in hand.</p>",
    "q2":"There's tremendous room for improvement in Baltimore's crime reduction strategy. Some areas I would encourage and support as a councilperson would be: comprehensive officer training; improved interaction between police and the community at large; and better knowledge of the law, procedures and protocols to are a must to ensure and build a strong police department that is also trusted by the public. The present leadership is a work in progress.</p>",
    "q3":"Freddie Gray's death and the subsequent uprising brought abruptly and starkly into view for the world to see that Baltimore City's majority population has been ignored and their concerns marginalized by the political and economic power structure for decades. The resulting despair, desperation, discontent and isolation led to an eruption of emotion. The lesson is inclusion, and addressing economic, social and political needs and concerns. Inclusion in these ways will lead to real and lasting change in their lives. This is key to a successful future for Baltimore City.</p>",
    "q4":"Baltimore City's current tax structure needs a complete overhaul: not only property and income taxes, but also fees. Tax increment financing and payment in lieu of taxes have consistently been disproportionately utilized to support the wealthy and their goals. I support their use for community based development not more harbor projects.</p>",
    "q5":"Use financial instruments such as tax increment financing and payments in lieu taxes in community- based development. Use eminent domain legislation more proactively to acquire properties in largely vacant areas. If this is done with transparency it should open up these areas for further development. V2V should be used on a sliding scale basis with value increasing as development values escalate. I am encouraged by the efforts of Gov. Hogan. It's a welcome beginning.</p>",
    "q6":"The chief barrier is lack of a long-term economic strategy. It's essential to bring together stakeholders in the private and public sectors to develop a comprehensive plan addressing the unique needs of each community. The youth must also have a place at the table. Long term goals must include: attracting new businesses while providing support for existing businesses to generate jobs; increase jobs and skills training opportunities in an effort to prepare City residents to take advantage of the newly generated jobs.</p>",
    "q7":"Limited changes are needed in the government structure. The budget process needs to allow for additions and/or cuts to the budget by the Council. The Board of Estimates needs a member who is separate from both the executive and legislative branches to ensure transparency. Perhaps a \"People's Counsel\" elected by the citizens.</p>",
    "q8":"The current council has definitely been focused on issues that are not true priorities More emphasis and attention needs to be placed on improving the functions of government, and accountability and controlling waste. A change in this direction should improve the council's responsiveness to the public.</p>",
    "q9":"Delivery of service is weak across the board. To improve response time and resident satisfaction, the City needs stronger and improved leadership, better training, fiscal accountability, less outside contractors, and more executive employees who live invested in the success of the City.</p>",
    "q10":"I've spent over 30 years helping and fighting for the community. I believe my passion for helping others and experience qualify me to be a true advocate for the 12th District.</p>"

    "q1":"Jobs:  I'll encourage developers and fellow colleagues on the council to respect the rule of reciprocity. The rule of reciprocity simply states that; if developers are going to do business in Baltimore City, they must be willing to train and hire local residents in my district. I'll champion the use of high‐road contractors that support good apprenticeship programs, job slots and pre‐apprenticeship training for local residents while implementing a comprehensive pre‐apprenticeship program.</p><p>Public Safety: ​I will reduce crime with strategies of prevention, intervention, suppression and collaboration. Crime is a major problem across our city, but crime is an bi-product of deeper issues--education and economics. As your councilman, I will strengthen the bonds between the community and the police department, focusing on community policing to tackle the distrust between citizen and police. This will help lower our crime rate.</p><p>Affordable Housing: We need rent control as an immediate step to address the crisis of out-of-control, unaffordable rent. Too many of our citizens pay too much money to live in deplorable conditions. Meanwhile, out of state landlords and developers get rich by raising rents, but not fixing properties.

    "q1":"One of the most pressing issues in my district is the lack of outlets for youth. There is little to nothing for the youth to do in many parts of the 13th district. Many young adults hang out in front of stores and bank machines. Some commit crimes. I would address this pressing issue by opening recreation centers in elementary schools in areas that do not have them. Also, I would take job literature to young men and women that are hanging around the neighborhood with out jobs. Moreover, in both Herring Run park and Clifton Park, there are five baseball/softball diamonds, but no baseball leagues for the youth. Thus, I would develop baseball leagues so that the youth can have fun, learn team work and be occupied.</p>",
    "q2":"It is hard to tell if Baltimore is pursuing the right strategies to reduce violent crime. We will need to compare last year's statistics to this year's statistics. I have met the current commissioner and he seems focused. As a city councilman, I would have police officers work/coach in the recreation centers. That way, they will know the youth, and the youth will know the officers.</p>",
    "q3":"The two main lessons that I draw from the death of Freddie Gray and the subsequent protests are that the police department needs to be more professional in certain areas i.e. transporting those that they arrest. Also, the youth need extracurricular activities: baseball, soccer, lacrosse. Moreover, if young people have jobs, they will be less likely to get involved in non productive activity.</p>",
    "q4":"Baltimore should reduce its property tax rates in areas that do not justify the percentage that it is taxed. Some neighborhoods have low tax rates, thus each neighborhood would need to be evaluated on a case by case basis. I think that it is a good idea to use tax increment financing because those developments bring jobs and in some cases, tourism dollars. Moreover, when a developer is given these incentives they should also build playgrounds, landscape and small building projects to beautify less developed neighborhoods.</p>",
    "q5":"Baltimore can encourage commercial and residential revitalization in neighborhoods away from the waterfront by adding in revitalization projects when they give tax incentives to developers. The Vacants to Value program probably needs to be revisited. Some properties don't warrant the amount that the city says must be invested. Governor Hogan stated that he will give $700 million to the effort of eradicating blight. It is much needed because neighborhoods that are full of abandoned homes are havens for crime and rodents. Once the buildings are demolished, there can be green space for sports, urban farming, landscaping or development.</p>",
    "q6":"Some areas are heavily crime ridden and they do not have the tax incentives that some jurisdictions may have. Also, the schools in certain areas are poor. If the city invests in programs like the teacher/cop next door, that might ignite development.</p>",
    "q7":"The current balance of power between the mayor and City Council seems appropriate. At this point I would not seek to change it.</p>",
    "q8":"Some City Councilmen and women have been focused on the right issues and some have been dormant. One poignant issue that I remember was when many in the city council requested body cameras on the Baltimore city police officers. The mayor declined, then later the Freddie Gray situation unfolded. If the officers had cameras, the police department and prosecutors would have an easier time figuring out what happened to him and how to proceed with improving those issues.</p>",
    "q9":"It seems that in some jurisdictions, there is more debris in the streets and in alleys than in others. So there may be some weaknesses in sanitation. I think that whoever is the councilperson in that district should put pressure on that agency to improve the face of the community.</p>",

    "q1":"The most pressing issues in my district are the lack of available services for positive youth development, workforce development, and a lack of community collaboration. I believe there need to be a survey of resources across the district to determine what works, what is required to enhance upon current services, barriers to engagement (especially for those at higher risk and less likely to participate). I believe the data should be used to develop a comprehensive strategy in collaboration with key stakeholders to ensure timely results for our residents as well as frequent checks and balances throughout the process to make certain of effective implementation. I envision a district that works together as a whole to address issues plaguing our district. Although the make up of the neighborhoods are not exactly the same, I believe working together to share resources, collectively pursue funding opportunities, and building strong neighborhoods allows us to become a stronger district. A district that is able to stand on its own, empower its neighborhoods, and support its residents.</p>",
    "q2":"I do believe Baltimore is pursing right strategies to reduce violent crimes. I am paying close attention to the decisions being made by leadership. I think it is important to remain engaged. I do appreciate the consistent attempts for community and-police relations as it is very important to continue building on the what was previously implemented by the past Commissioner. I believe that hot-spots in the district that are of higher risk continues to require a more specific approaches to address the violence within those areas. I would work closely with leaders, residents, and police to ensure that we are working on efforts to decrease crime but also funnel necessary resources to address the social ills that continue to be the root cause of such crimes.</p>",
    "q3":"The lessons I draw from the death of Freddie Gray has allowed me to develop an even deeper compassion for our youth and for the people who support them. Our families are hurting all over Baltimore City due to the lack of meaningful income earning opportunities, inadequate housing, educational barriers, and poverty stricken communities. While I do not agree with the manner in which the protest progressed into a storm of violence, I understand the level of anger pinned within the hearts of our youth and unfortunately the death of Freddie Gray became an outlet for them to express just how pissed off they are and continue to be. If you have not experienced their lifestyle, you can not understand the influence nor magnitude of the situation. I am in no way attempting to make excuses for their behavior and to take a life is simply wrong. A title does not grant authority for murder. Killing can not be condoned period and the unrest after the tragic death of Freddie Gray is a reminder that we must do more to address the issues surrounding our youth which means supporting families. After-all, they are our future.</p>",
    "q4":"I believe that Baltimore should reduce its property tax rate or there should be a standard rate across the board. The tax rate in better communities of residents with higher incomes, tend to pay less and the communities of residents with less incomes tend to pay more. I do not understand how this is possible? I believe that the city's use of tax increment financing does not benefit the community and are only in the interest of developments such as Harbor Point? Harbor Point and its surrounding areas are the city's assets. It feels as if the city at this point make this area a priority while the remaining areas of the city look like ghost towns; however, in regards to incentives - they should be geared towards property owners and homeowners to revitalize neighborhoods and increase value in their homes. Citizens want to know that our elected officials care about them and that they are going to vote for options that make sense and benefit Baltimore City as a collective not just the interest of big businesses who already have a huge financial advantage as well as countless tax breaks.</p>",
    "q5":"I believe that Baltimore City can do more to encourage commercial and residential revitalization in neighborhoods by creating incentives for home-ownership, creating incentives for neighborhoods to gain ownership of properties within their communities, and by encouraging building pride within those communities matched with real opportunities that promote sustainability. The Vacants to Value initiative is a good initiative, I would like to see our community associations be in a position to acquire properties for the benefit of new homeowners and affordable housing opportunities. When communities are empowered or city becomes more powerful. I am happy to see resources being funneled into the Sand town-Windchester community as it is very much needed ; however, the community has been in dire need for many years and unfortunately our City and State continues to be reactive to the needs of our communities opposed to proactive. In regards to other areas such as the water front, it seems to be a lot of energy and innovation around being proactive with resources and plans as it relates development and revitalization.</p>",
    "q6":"I believe that the consensus of residents is that it feels like the more money you make and try to save, the more you have to pay out. People feel bound by taxes and do not reap the benefit of tax breaks. There is a need for more skilled workers, higher wages, entrepreneurship opportunities, support and incentives for Small Business Owners. I would address these issues by collaborating with small business owners to help develop plans for sustainability and support efforts to secure resources. I would work in collaboration with residents and local community to identify opportunities to gain and enhance current skills. I would also work to provide additional incentives for local business chains such as anchor stores to hire from within.</p>",
    "q7":"I believe that if the Baltimore City Council use its voice/vote as it is intended and written, the balance would be appropriate. There has been a continuum of \"go with the flow\" votes in regard to vetoing plans brought forth by the Mayor. It is concerning that over 30years the council has been in support of plans, bills, policy, and ordinances brought forth by Mayors for such a long time. It is no wonder that Baltimore City is in it's current situation- facing a huge deficit as the current Mayor transitions out of office. We have to do better and citizens have to do better with holding elected officials accountable. It is important to use your vote for what it is your community is asking of you. When that vote does not appear to be enough, we as elected officials have to galvanize our constituency. The power is always with the constituents never really with the elected official- they represent MANY votes while a council member represents ONE.</p>",
    "q8":"The City Council deals with all the right issues as they have developed committees to cover all areas concerning the City as a whole. It is not necessarily the question of the right issues opposed to making the best decisions when it come to voting. The question is are our communities happy with the work of the City Council over the years? I do not think so. There is a real outcry for change and I believe the vote this year will show just how unsatisfied people are with the work of the Council thus far. I am very excited to see a push for additional resources for youth. In reference to understanding exactly what has been worked on for the last four years, I am not totally up to par on those issues mostly due to a lack of belief that issues that are of concern to myself and my district often seem to miss more than hit the mark.</p>",
    "q9":"The only issue I see with the delivery of services is the lack of good customer service across the board. I believe that an initiative centered around customer service and effective communication would be very helpful with improving upon both response time and resident satisfaction. A resident should feel that whenever they reach out to a city service they will be treated with respect, their issues will be taken into consideration, and a real effort will be made for the issue to be addressed.</p>",
    "q10":"I am running for office because I have a desire to serve my community. I have been doing so for over ten years in many capacities and will continue to do so with or without a seat. It is important that our community have a representative at the table who has the communities best interest at heart. I am committed to doing the work. I am active and have a clear understanding of the dire needs that plague our community. I experience my community on a daily basis and the same issues that impact my neighbors also impact me. I put my name on the ballot because I truly believe that it is time for our community to be heard, to be put first, and it is time that the community benefit from the fact that District thirteen is at the table.</p>"

By ensuring that residents have access to and are ready for jobs we can reduce crime in our community. Ensuring communities trust the police department is also critical. We should focus not on the destruction, but the energy that communities had in coming together to clean up. We need to harness this energy to help build a better Baltimore.</p>",
    "q4":"Baltimore cannot make a meaningful cut in its property tax rate without expanding its tax base. Before we expand the tax base any cuts will hurt our most disadvantaged neighbors and programs for seniors and youth. Currently, Baltimore City Schools are not getting their fair share in education funding because of Tax Increment Funding. The formula currently recognizes the increased property values in TIF areas, and assumes that the city is realizing the financial benefits of the increase. However, the increased value is going toward paying off TIF bonds. I would advocate for legislation that recognizes the issues, and ensures that Baltimore is getting its share in education funding. TIFs and PILOTs must be used to help development throughout Baltimore, not just in the neighborhoods around the waterfront.</p>",
    "q5":"As the next City Councilperson I would act as a liaison between the developers and the neighborhoods to ensure that projects are investments in the community and help benefit my neighbors without displacing them. Vacants to Values has not had an impact on the 13 District. I welcome Governor Hogan's recent announcement to remove blight from District 13.</p>",
    "q6":"While there are plenty of jobs in District 13 and throughout the City of Baltimore, job readiness and job accessibility are some of the biggest barriers. Using Community Benefits Agreements (CBAs) and Project Labor Agreements (PLAs) ensures Baltimore City residents are working on Baltimore City projects, and that Baltimore City residents earn fair wages and that projects are investments in communities.</p>",
    "q7":"Currently, there is an imbalance of power between the Mayor and City Council. The mayor is a very powerful position and controls the budgetary process, and needs little input from the Council. I would work to see greater oversight over the budgetary process.</p>",
    "q8":"The council could always do more to address lead paint poison, homelessness and crime and community relations. The Council has passed 'Ban the Box,' they have dedicated 3% of the budget to youth programs, and there was legislation that did not pass to grade restaurant cleanliness.</p>",
    "q9":"While it is easier than ever to report problems in the city through calling 311, the 311 app, and reporting it online, the problems are still not being addressed by the City. Ensuring that residents concerns are being addressed and not ignored is an important step in addressing quality of life issues. Regular financial and performance audits of agencies will begin to ensure that agencies are responding to residents concerns.</p>",

See next question on how I would improve police-community relations.</p>",
    "q3":"Remembering the racial unrest that occurred in 1960s Baltimore, I know that this is a long-standing and complicated issue. Yet, I believe there have been successful initiatives that could be re-imagined for today’s Baltimore.  For instance, Republican Mayor, Theodore R. McKeldin had the Baltimore city police place store-front offices in the neighborhoods where dissatisfaction and unrest were at their worst.  The storefronts allowed police departments to discuss issues. directly with citizens and the community.  Furthermore, McKeldin deployed portable playgrounds into neighborhoods, and kept swimming pools and fire hydrants open past normal hours.</p><p>As a footnote: Because of his success, governor McKeldin was appoint by President Johnson to take charge of Washington DC, which at the time had far more severe difficulties, and he was later praised by then Vice-President Hubert Humphrey as being successful in Washington as well.</p>",

That trend must be reversed. </P><p>Secondly, there are opportunities for improvement, such as in the area of Reistertown rd between Park Circle and Belvedere where salvageable vacant houses should be offered for a dollar in return for committed ownership for 5-7 years.  </p>",
    "q6":"Unemployment caused by the lack of blue-collar jobs must be addressed by our educational system as well as elected leadership. Private businesses need to be welcomed to Baltimore, on a permanent basis, possibly through tax incentives and other accommodations. </p>",
    "q7":"No, the balance of power is inappropriate, but more importantly, future mayors should not be using Ravens and Oriole tickets to get city council members to vote for, or against, certain bills.  That in itself has demeaned the relationship.  There should be civil discourse at all times, to come to reasonable conclusions of the extremely complicated problems that occur in modern day Baltimore City.</p>",
    "q8":"Again I reiterate, the proper issues have not been dealt with, such as police and community relations, which is as much the responsibility of the city council as it is the Mayors office, and I have perceived it has been largely been ignored.</p><p>Furthermore, fatherless children, and difficulties of disadvantaged youth should be investigated by a committee appointed by the city council, and that I consider salient to the future of Baltimore City.</p>",
    "q9":"Months ago a robbery attempt occurred as I was leaving the downtown Basilica. A man came up to my car and demanded my money. I called the police, who never came.  Recruitment must be enhanced, as it was in with successful results in the 1970s, in order to return our police department to full force.</p><p>Though there is work being committed to some of our streets, I have never seen this level of disrepair in our infrastructure, which is the fault of the public works and the Mayor’s office.  Because the present Mayor’s cut backs on the amount of meter readers in the Baltimore city, millions of dollars were never collected, and outrageous errors have occurred in utility billing, causing the most vulnerable to be overcharged hundreds of dollars.  The water department needs to be adequately staffed and our city services made a priority.</p><p>Lastly, the current Mayoral administration has tried to encourage undocumented immigrants to live in Baltimore, and though I appreciate the compassion, many of our less fortunate citizens have been deprived of jobs and education because of the funds allocated toward this effort. We must take of our own citizens.</p>",
    "q10":"As a life-long city resident, I’ve become deeply concerned with the repetition of long term problems, such as with poor accounting procedures, and with a board of education, which continues to lose money and does not have an effective product. In that, violence against teachers and students persists and though the number of highschool graduates has increased, the grades on achievement tests have stayed low, preventing opportunities that those students should enjoy.</p><P>Secondly, I have deep concerns regarding our unrepaired streets, as well as other infrastructure, including our water department, which has had tremendously difficulty with miscalculating bills for residents, the city, and all parts of Baltimore County.</P><P>In final, excessive homicides and drug use continue to be a major problem throughout the city, along with fatherless homes and a disconnect between the police department and citizens, which should be thoughtfully addressed.</p>"

    "q1":"The 14th Council District is diverse, creative, and caring. Breaking the current cycle of crime in our neighborhoods is the primary demand and requirement in these times, whatever the neighborhood --- but especially where the crime is violent and the neighbors enveloped in its culture, climate, and heartbreaks. </p><p>It is my responsibility to ensure that the officers leading our local police districts are effective, responsive and caring. I am constantly in touch with them and attest that, in Eastern, Northeast, and Northern Police Districts, our commanders are striving to meet our demanding standards for their work and consistently encouraging their officers to likewise serve as our communities expect and deserve. </p><p>Other pressing issues in our district include:</p><p>- the expectation of good schools and ample opportunities for our youth; </p><p>- safer pedestrian walkways and street crossings, especially near schools, playgrounds, and senior buildings; </p><p>- traffic calming on all our neighborhood streets as a pro-active citywide policy; </p><p>- clean streets, alleys, neighborhoods;</p><p>- Community notice and engagement in the planning of new developments and institutional expansions; and,</p><p>- Snow removal plans that neighbors can understand, track and affect in real time.</p>",
    "q2":"I have confidence in the Police Department's current leadership. Commissioner Kevin Davis impresses me as a respected professional who understands the urgency to bring stability, accountability, and morale to the department. </p><p>Most impressively, Commissioner Davis has demonstrated his respect for our citizens and neighborhoods. The department's 14th District command staffs are professional, effective, and community-responsive. We hear from them, they listen to us, and bonds are forming at that level. </p><p>The challenge is to bridge the gaps between communities and the many frontline officers who see us only at our 911 worst. One solution often suggested is restoration of the Police Athletic League (PAL) through which frontline officers ran popular recreation programs for neighborhood children and youth. </p><p>Those younger officers loved their PAL roles, despite lacking the supplies and budgets they needed to sustain the program. But PAL is worth repeating as a bridge-builder at the grassroots level of neighborhoods and the department. For starters, let's try adequate funding for one pilot per City Council district.</p>",
    "q3":"The Freddie Gray lesson is that we must better serve our children and youth, especially the thousands raised by good families in poverty surroundings, hundreds of whom are disabled by the lead paint poisoning in the only homes their families can afford. To better serve requires affordable and decent housing growing up, special education resources, mentors and job opportunities instead of defaults to drug market competing outside the front door. </p><p>As to the peaceful protests, they were overdue and will hopefully lead to radical changes in how Baltimore cares for its families and children and in how our police department treats and regards the citizens it is sworn to serve and protect. As for the unrest, it should be remembered as of one day's duration, invaded by looters who disgraced themselves and us all before the world, and as followed by a sweeping-up by neighbors and an outpouring of help from all quarters, ongoing to this day.</p>",
    "q4":"Even granted narrowly for only owner-occupied residential properties, the individual property savings from the mayor's local tax credits or from potential property tax rate reductions bring minimal relief to individual tax bills compared to the major negative toll such losses take on a city government faced with urgent fiscal obligations, from promised new recreation centers to full implementation of police body cameras. </p><p>As for tax incentives, Baltimore has reached the point of needing to decide, \"What's the plan?\" Our rising assessable base makes us too wealthy for the State education funds we require, but tax incentives leave us too \"cash poor\" to afford the loss. The time has come to narrow the scope of consideration for such tax advantages to what \"the plan\" will determine are the essentials for Baltimore's successful future. </p><p>Perhaps those essentials include developments offering decent fulltime jobs to which city residents have affordable and reliable transportation and the chance of being hired. And perhaps mixed-income housing to which our low-and-moderate income families can relocate from lead infected rental units. We need that planning context as prelude to deciding the cost-effective incentives we can afford if we are to attract what the city needs, not simply react to what the next developer proposes. </p>",
    "q5":"Success follows success. In the 14th District, private sector commercial and residential revitalization is significant, but it is concentrated in specific parts of the district and lacking in others. I often wish we could wave a wand to equalize the distribution. </p><p>Except for highly subsidized exceptions, the racial demographics of a neighborhood play a disproportionate role in private development decision-making. In commercial areas, the perceived safety and sanitation are deciding factors for investment. </p><p>Developers in overlooked residential neighborhoods are typically single rowhouse investors rehabbing for absentee rental, a source of frustration to neighborhood leaders seeking affordable homeownership options. Affordable homeownership is where public investment can make the most difference to overlooked neighborhoods, providing incentives to tip the scale in favor of restored stability.</p><p>We thank Governor Hogan for his announced effort to provide demolition funding to eliminate blight in Baltimore neighborhoods. We hope that a share of this funding will be invested in finishing the multi-year relocation and clearing of a 3-block area in the Coldstream-Homestead-Montebello neighborhood called the \"Tivoly Triangle.\" We invite him to be our guest in seeing and envisioning the potential. </p>",
    "q6":"A skilled, trained, and available employee base will attract new economic development to Baltimore and encourage the expansion of existing employment centers. In recent years, Baltimore has succeeded in retaining more young college graduates as city residents than in the recent past. The special arts districts deserve a share of credit for this millennial population boom, both within these districts and in nearby neighborhoods. </p><p>The challenge in building upon this promising base, however, is to educate, train, and promote our home-grown public school students as the magnets for economic development in every field of endeavor, from STEM to STEAM. Hopkins School of Engineering is already equipping and training Barclay School students in state of the art technology for 21st century careers. Robotics clubs and courses are cropping-up across the school system. If we focus on such successes as trendsetters and engage our colleges and universities in tailoring higher education tracks for our students, our homegrown graduates will become the talent pool that promotes Baltimore as \"the place\" to locate and recruit.</p>",
    "q7":"With power comes accountability. I have long supported the \"strong mayor\" form of city government, because it ensures specific accountability for how the city spends our taxes. </p><p>In the current structure, the mayor controls 3 votes on the 5-member Board of Estimates which controls the city budget. The Board is chaired by the President of the City Council, and the City Comptroller is a member, both voting as independent elected officials. The Mayor's 3 votes are her own and those of the other 2 members, both of whom she appoints to their paid positions as City Solicitor and Director of Public Works. The system is designed to guarantee a consistent mayoral majority.</p><p>This Board of Estimates originates the City's annual budget and approves it for introduction as an ordinance to the City Council. The City Council can approve, disapprove, or approve with cuts. Funding is often cut when City Council wants the funding used for a different purpose than proposed. The Council, however, does not have the power to transfer cut funds to that other purpose. Only the Board has that authority, and mayors usually refuse to make the requested transfer. In a stalemate, the cut funds must be used to cut the property tax.</p><p>Council's right to transfer its cuts is a change I might support, provided the budget's bottom line remains the same. </p>",
    "q8":"Let me focus on City Council's role in standing traditional budget making on its head by writing our children and youth into the pages of the city budget and working for steady annual increases until this priority comes into fiscal balance with other crucial services. </p><p>Since my 14th District election in 2004 and certainly in the past 4 years, the Baltimore City Council has been a leader in promoting the needs of Baltimore's children and youth and influencing the creation and annual growth of the city's children and youth budget as a focal point of annual city budget deliberations. </p><p>In 2014, City Council unanimously and successfully requested the addition of $4 million to the fiscal year 2016 budget for increases to after school, out of school, summer school, and community school programs. In January 2016, City Council adopted a proposed Charter amendment requiring a 3% dedication of annual general funds to children and youth, a jump-start on meeting our obligations to Baltimore's future. </p><p>Of all the diverse and \"right issues\" addressed in Council's 2011-2016 term of office, writing children and youth into the budget and persisting in that budget's annual growth have been the most enduring and \"rightest\" from my perspective.</p>",
    "q9":"CitiStat is on the mend but needs restoration as a reliable tool for agency assessment and accountability on a regular schedule, with city leaders involved, and solutions to failed responses discussed for better outcomes going forward. CitiStat is 311's accountability tool as well, connecting constituent input to agency response. CitiStat has also served to convene diverse stakeholders on specific public issues and assess steps to resolve complex issues such as legal barriers to effective domestic violence prosecution. Restoring the CitiStat function to its proper oversight role will improve response time and resident satisfaction, because, like all of us, --- as with this questionnaire --- we work hardest when reporting deadlines loom.</p>",
    "q10":"I \"came of age\" in Baltimore in the aftermath of the assassination of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. and the riots that followed. As neophyte community and political activists and amidst a quietude of City political leadership, hundreds of us found each other and joined forces to help rebuild a fairer and more united Baltimore from the neighborhoods up. With a new City Council, I hope to share that life-changing experience of positive outcomes from devastating setbacks and my confidence in the power of our citizenry to effect changes that matter for the better. This era is one not to miss for the wonders it can bring. </p>"

    "q1":"The most pressing issues are community redevelopment, crime and affordable housing. To combat crime, I would advocate for more community based police officers. There has been a lot of distrust with the police department, so citizens are less likely to tell them if they know of a crime that has been committed. I would also advocate for stronger witness protection. For citizens to come forward with information, they have to feel safe. Since Baltimore is city of neighborhoods, there redevelopment is key to the rebuilding of the city. Certain neighborhoods have been forgotten and look like third world country's. We need to bring small and local businesses back to our neighborhoods. This can create job growth and reinvestment back into the communities. Great schools and affordable housing will bring new citizens into our existing great neighborhoods. Affordable housing is an issue for many of the residents in my district. In my neighborhood, Coldstream Homestead Montebello, many of the residents are stuck paying high rent for substandard housing. To combat, I will limited the number outside developer rental units in impoverished neighborhoods. I would attract developers to create affordable homes for purchase. I would create mix use developments where there is a mix of rental units and units for purchase.</p>",

    "q3":"With the unrest in the city, we learned our citizens are fed up with business as usual. We learned that we can no longer take our citizens for granted. We learned that the residents of the city are looking for a hand up and not a hand out. Even though the unrest destroyed certain areas of the city, it also brought the residents closer together. I witnessed this first hand while on the scene at Penn North the day after the unrest. Citizens from all over the city was on the scene to cleanup in the aftermath of the unrest. The death of Freddie Gray exposed some of the weaknesses in some of the current police procedures and policies. His death placed a national spotlight on the issue of police brutality and the use of excessive force. From this we learned that the citizens of Baltimore will no longer stand by and let the concerns go unanswered and unaddressed.</p>",
    "q4":"Yes, the property tax rate for home owners should be reduced in Baltimore. One way to achieve this is to reduce the amount of property tax breaks that are giving to large businesses. A reduction in property taxes should not be the main selling point to attract developments such as Harbor Point.</p>",
    "q5":"Small and local businesses are the key to neighborhood revitalization. Small business is the key to bringing new investment, revenue and residents back to our communities. We need to make Baltimore a small business friendly city. To do this, we need to create incentives for small businesses. I would endorse and support incentives for hiring residents of the communities where these businesses will be located. The Vacants to Value program is a good to start to removing blight from our neighborhoods. I have seen first hand how this program, when used correctly, can eradicate urban blight. In the Coldstream Homestead Montebello neighborhood, the Vacants to Value program allowed us to eradicate an abandoned multi unit structure and an entire block of vacant and run down houses.</p>",
    "q6":"One of the chief barriers is opportunity. Before there is economic development and job creation, there has to be an opportunity for economic development and job creation. To create these opportunities, we have to attract these opportunities to our city. We need to highlight the fact that we are a sought after convention city and companies offering convention services can thrive in Baltimore. We need to highlight our proximity to an international airport and our proximity to the port and use this to attract opportunities to our city.</p>",
    "q7":"Baltimore is a mayor strong city. This means that the mayors share of power of the city is strong. I do believe that the balance of power is unbalanced. I would advocate to have the city council to have more control or more of a say in the operations of the city. One way I would change this is to change the structure of the Board of Estimates. With the mayor currently having three of the five votes of the board in unbalanced. With three votes, it is easier for the mayor to get funding for their priorities, which may or may not be the priorities of the council or the city.</p>",
    "q8":"I do believe the council has been focused on some of the right issues. Some of the issues that I believe the council has addressed in the correct manner of the last four year include, police body cameras, funding for youth programs, and the re-writing of our zoning code</p>",
    "q9":"The major weaknesses with the delivery of city services is communication and follow up. While I am out talking and listening to residents, many of them have issues when reporting issues to 311. The major issue they have is that many times their concerns are never addressed or there was no followup to their issue. The recent cleanup from the blizzard showed weaknesses in city services. Many residents were left in the dark as to when their streets were going to be cleaned. When asked of the street clearing map could be made public, the city's response was that is was not feasible. To improve the followup and communication, I would work with city agency directors to institute a time line for all service calls. Once the service is complete, A call or email would be sent to the resident to inform them that their issue has been addressed.</p>",

We need a City Council that responds to the needs of the citizens.</p><p>Most of our problems are the result of a lack of economic, educational, and recreational opportunities for our youth. Our city needs an elected school board, programs to incentives co-ops, and more vocational training available to the residents.</p><p>We also need real police reform, with more citizen involvement in hiring, training, and promoting practices.</p>",
    "q2":"I do not believe violent crime is being addressed effectively. And it's too early to say that I have confidence in the BPD's current leadership.</p><p>Improving the relationship between the police and the community is critical, and we can go about this in many ways: Our promotion system should be based on community feedback as opposed to metrics. We can reintroduce police-led youth programs. We need more police walking through our neighborhoods. More selective hiring and a service-based training approach.</p><p>We can actively promote our Public Safety Forums so that the public can actually attend. Right now we employ the opposite strategy.</p><p>And as for the citizens, we can treat these officers as individuals. Do not paint anyone with a broad brush. Name names. Good ones and bad ones. When you have a positive encounter with a helpful and dedicated police officer, please write to their commander. When you have a negative encounter, do the same, and make sure that the response is timely and appropriate.</p>",
    "q3":"I learned that the police practices in Baltimore warrant international attention. And that most of our citizens don't feel well-represented or served by our government. And that we don't seem to have an appropriate method of dealing with unrest.</p>",
    "q4":"At this time Baltimore cannot afford to reduce its tax rate without comprehensive audits to see where we actually stand. Then we need to expand our tax base. TIFs and PILOTs wouldn't be so detrimental if we were able to introduce and enforce clauses that require the recipient to hire locally, hire minority workers, buy locally, and benefit the community by contributing to youth centers or parks. But without those stipulations we're simply funneling our resources out of the community.</p>",
    "q5":"I'd be more satisfied with Vacants to Value if it was applicable city-wide, instead of being neighborhood specific. Governor Hogan's decision to leave the fate of our vacants (and millions of dollars) in the hands of the Maryland Stadium Authority was ludicrous. And I believe we should be promoting the co-operative business model, encouraging business growth within our communities instead of attempting to court it from elsewhere.</p>",
    "q6":"We need more educational and vocational opportunities for our citizens, young and old. We also need to require the recipients of TIFs to buy and hire locally to stimulate our economy.</p>",
    "q7":"The current balance is inappropriate. I see no reason for the mayor to appoint two members to the Board of Estimates. We need more seats reserved for members of the City Council, or a representative from the community.</p>",
    "q8":"The City Council hasn't taken leadership positions on economic development, environmentalism, or youth empowerment. And its granting of TIFs for various development projects have been questionable.</p>",
    "q9":"City services are not delivered equitably throughout the city. Poorer neighborhoods have fewer trashcans, fewer snowplows, longer police and 311 response time. We need a plan that accommodates all neighborhoods equally. We also need change at the Department of Public Works. Water bills are high and unpredictable, and the process through which a person disputes a bill is almost a total waste of time.</p>",

    "q1":"1) Crime and illegal drugs: In collaboration with the police department form a community task force with residents who are willing to be visible change agents in eradicating crime and drugs from each neighborhood. Identify hot spots and collect relevant information and allow police to target people, locations and activities one neighborhood at a time. I would pursue initiatives that decriminalize possession of some drugs for personal use. </p><p>2) Economic development, job creation and unemployment: Work with existing employers to identify low skilled jobs and develop employee readiness programs for local residents to fill these positions, once employed develop career pathways and training programs to facilitate advancement. Work with growing businesses who are creating new jobs to establish workforce development offerings that will invest in preparing our local workers for these new jobs in collaboration with local schools and colleges. </p><p>3) K-12 education: Public school reform is critical. Transforming the city/state partnership created in 1997 to reflect 21st century needs should be the starting point. This agreement outlines roles, responsibilities and oversight of K-12 which must vest more direct responsibility locally to ensure a critical eye is applied directly over the operations and management of school district resources by the school board (which should become partially elected) and other local elected officials and citizens. I will champion efforts to bring the community schools model to every city school. Community schools embed wrap-around programs and services in schools making them accessible to both the students and families.</p>",
    "q2":"No. Yes. I drafted legislation which was favorably approved by the 2015 general assembly and signed by Gov. Hogan in May 2015 to require an annual report from Baltimore Police Department on \"Community Policing\" outcomes. The first such report was released on January 1, 2016 and is available on the police department's website. Additionally, I wrote a course curriculum for the police academy for a 4-hour block of instruction that brought academy class #15-01 to a local school to engage directly with students, faculty and community leaders. This curriculum was approved by the prior police commissioner and is being adopted by the new, current commissioner for inclusion in upcoming academy classes. As president I will lead an initiative that brings the police together with neighborhood leaders to tear down barriers to cooperative community policing.</p>",
    "q3":"The youth of Baltimore City responded this Spring to their perceptions that positive investments in their future have not occurred and that they wanted their displeasure heard in a big way. While their displeasure may have been viewed negatively by some, it should have sent a loud resounding vibration to everyone that the status quo is unacceptable. The lesson I learned is our over investment in the police department must be off-set with investments in positive youth development opportunities.</p>",
    "q4":"Taxes should be reduced in a responsible fashion that is equitable and measured so that it does not adversely impact the delivery of high quality public services. While the local tax base has been diminished by white and middle-class flight, it is imperative that the remaining tax revenue not be squandered on development TIFs and PiLots that produce no benefit to the residents and result in false-assessments of the city's wealth thus reducing state economic aid to the remaining residents who are chiefly low income individuals and families.</p>",
    "q5":"Neighborhood revitalization must begin with inclusion of residents in the discussions, planning and development process. Small commercial and residential housing projects can quickly change the landscape of blighted neighborhoods. While incentives that provide tax breaks may be the most lucrative for developers other incentives that are less harmful to the municipal budget bottom-line (especially funding for schools) must be identified and implemented through laws and policies approved by the city council and as president I will champion those efforts. I will work with the city's Finance Board to effect the necessary changes in both law and policy in this matter. Partnerships with neighborhood community development corporations will empower residents and build their capacity to become leaders in revitalizing their neighborhoods. Vacants to Value generally is a failure. It has not produced the \"value\" of new affordable residential development and has chiefly produced new vacant land where houses use to stand. Governor Hogan's announcement while encouraging is also disappointing in that it did not include an option for neighborhoods to participate in the initiative, and it conveyed a lack of confidence in the local municipal government's ability to take a leadership role in the proposed efforts and instead vested the responsibility with a state agency the Maryland Stadium Authority.</p>",
    "q6":"Structural racism, low educational achievement, inadequate workforce readiness and substandard public transportation. The reality of the disparity that 2 separate and distinct Baltimores exist is a key barrier that must be eliminated. The social and economic disparities are often perpetuated by the actions of city government. Uptown vs downtown should only be destinations, but instead they represent divides in investments and opportunities. Redlining of opportunities and investments exists and government's role has to include ensuring those barriers are erased. It is widely perceived that government does nothing to change these dynamics and is a contributor as well. I will work with institutions, business, banks, mortgage companies, technology/communications businesses like Verizon to reverse these trends. Job creation is chiefly dependent on employers concluding that a ready workforce and favorably marketplace conditions exist in a specific location. Unfortunately Baltimore City no longer has a workforce sufficiently trained and skilled for many of the 21st century businesses that may be considering growth here. Improving educational outcomes for students attending our K-12 schools is a very high priority on my agenda. Additionally, our workforce pool includes many unemployed and displaced workers who have no viable re-training opportunities available. Investments in worker readiness and training must be made that truly turn the unemployed into productive employed citizens. I will work closely with the Mayor's Office of Employment Development to achieve these goals.</p>",
    "q7":"No. the balance of power is weighted heavily in favor of the mayor which limits the city council's ability to actively participate in governance and oversight of the city's business. Changes to the make up of the Board of Estimates is necessary to better align the balance of power between the office holders elected by the residents to govern and provide checks and balances over each of the other office holders. Additionally, the city council must be afforded opportunities to represent the citizens with voting membership on a number of municipal boards and commissions that govern critical city functions that serve citizens, like the hotel board and the finance board. I would seek to obtain the support of the entire council, to change the city charter to shift the balance of power accordingly and more equitably.</p>",
    "q8":"No. The council has taken a passive role on many emerging issues and has assumed a very reactive posture when it should be more proactive in addressing clear and present issues that plague our city. Important issues include: Increasing funding for youth programming, youth curfew, reauthorizing the minority/women owned business participation law, local hiring law, employee compensation/benefits reform, the Harbor Point TIF, police body-cameras, audits and quarterly budget briefings. Most of these issues have been initiated by the mayoral administration and the council's action was simply to favorable pass the legislation with little or no value added.</p>",
    "q9":"The weaknesses are numerous and include sanitation, water and sewer rates/pipes/meters, housing, homeless services, street repairs, billing and accounting problems. The city council lacks a committee that focuses on the delivery of services to residents. As president I will establish a human services committee and establish constituent open door sessions/forums to hear resident concerns and issues with the various services. These sessions would be attended by agency representatives who will be held accountable for directly addressing/improving resident satisfaction.</p>",
    "q10":"I am an active citizen and have held public service positions my entire professional life. I believe holding an elected public office is the most logical next step to further advance the public causes I have been passionate about reforming. I strongly believe that I possess the education, training, management and leadership experience to excel as the Baltimore City Council President in my hometown which I passionately love.</p>"

    "q1":"The Crisis of 60% Unemployment in the 6th district where I reside amongst Black men between the ages of 18-45, whilst illegal aliens are hired on federal, state and city funded contracts, as the result of the implementation of the \"Sanctuary Policy\" for \"New Americans\" promulgated by Bob Embry of the Abell Foundation, David Warnock, and Donald Frey both of the Greater Baltimore Committee. If elected I would work to defeat most of the policies that are supported by the Sunpaper Editorial Board, the GBC and BMC</p><p>I find it appalling that American citizens and Veterans can't find work because the Mayor, City Council, GBC, BMC, and the Sun Editorial Board thinks that a Sanctuary Policy benefits Baltimore, when most of the illegal aliens working on these contracts don't live and aren't taxed in the City.</p><p>There is also the issue of Langston Hughes Elementary School that was placed on a list for closure--it's bad enough, this is one of the newer schools, but to close it when we have schools that are in greater disrepair</p><p>I would vote against granting TIFFS and Pilots to any contractor who does not have a plan to hire at least 40% of its workforce on any given project from within Baltimore City.</p>",
    "q2":"The Sunpaper , broadcast media, elected & appointed officials have been lying about the duty of the Baltimore Police and City government to protect the people from crime, when the Supreme Court has decided that no police agency or government has an affirmative duty to protect any individuals from crime---No, I have no confidence in the BPD, </p><p>From 2010-2015 I led the campaign to have the Department of Justice investigate and take BPD into federal receivership for Police Brutality, murder and other deprivations of civil rights under color of law.</p><p>I would improve relationships with the BPD demanding that the Sheriff, who is the elected Chief Executive Law Enforcement Officer to Deputize those citizens who wish to engage in neighborhood watch and patrol, whereby the Common Law right of Citizens arrest can be made against all lawbreakers, be they civilian and or law enforcement blatantly violating the rights of the People.</p><p>I would ask the Baltimore Grand Jury investigate the nexus between Safe Streets East, 300 Men, Brandon Scott, Guns, Heroine, the BPD Evidence Locker, the BPD Confidential Informant Program, and the claims on the streets that many of the murders are in retaliation for the prosecution of the six BPD officers charged in the death of Freddy Gray.</p><p>I would demand that the Department of Justice investigate the murders of Anthony Anderson, Officer William Torbit, Maurice Donald Johnson, George Booker Wells, Tyrone West and Monet Turnage to name a few that were swept under the rug by the Sunpaper.</p>",
    "q3":"I led the campaign to have the DOJ investigate BPD for police brutality, murder and other deprivation of civil rights which violate 18 USC 242 and 18 USC 1111. </p><p>What I have learned is that the news media ... have engaged in blood libeling Black youth and men as the cause of all of the crime and grime in the city and that has caused the BPD to view all Black men and youth as suspects in the War on Drugs.</p><p>I led People's assemblies and protest, the news media, didn't blame the fans of the Orioles who started the unrest by throwing bottles and racial slurs at protestors who went to disrupt the Orioles game--Black youth were labeled thugs.</p><p>I would listen to the people, on the streets and in the business suites, and learn from what they have to say and implement the best policies that would help to eliminate generational poverty that Baltimore City's Black majority has been forced to endure because of the implementation of policy initiatives like Baltimore Unbound. </p>",
    "q4":"Yes the municipal corporation must reduce its tax rate by the same procedures it was used to raise them.</p><p>I do not support TIF or the PILOT program and would work vigorously to abolish them</p>",
    "q5":"Baltimore should elect individuals who are beholden to the People and not to the Greater Baltimore Committee or the Baltimore Metropolitan Council.</p><p>Imminent Domain has been abused by the City, BDC and EBDI in the ethnic cleansing of East Baltimore for Johns Hopkins School of Public Health and Hospital and should be revisited.</p><p>I give the Vacants to Value Program an F, and Hogan's appropriation of $700 Million to combat blight would have been better used for either Education or a Temporary Employment Program for the youth to combat blight.</p>",
    "q6":"1. The media that only presents the government and GBC's position on Economic Development.</p><p>2. The Abell Foundations \"New American\" Policy of placing illegal aliens in the \"Work Force Readiness programs\" whilst placing US Citizens (mostly Blacks) in the \"Job Training\" programs.</p><p>The Sanctuary Policy of allowing illegal aliens to take jobs away from US Citizens and Resident Aliens that was pushed by the Abell Foundation, it drives down wages and allows non-residents from as far south as Leesburg, VA to work on Federal, State, and City funded contracts.</p><p>I would lobby to end these policies and other policies that are formulated by the GBC/BMC and others that do not benefit the majority of the people of Baltimore</p>",
    "q7":"By enforcing the City Charter, the Maryland Declaration of Rights, and Article XI of the Maryland Constitution, as it relates to Baltimore City</p>",
    "q8":"The City Council has since 1967 has helped to sell off all of the City's assets from its interest in BGE, Friendship Airport, Ft. Smallwood Park, Baltimore City Hospital, The Baltimore Zoo, The Baltimore Jail, the Baltimore Aquarium, the Baltimore Science Center and others.</p><p>They have closed schools, rec centers, have allowed more than 100 million dollars to go missing from the Baltimore City Public Schools and no one has been held accountable.</p><p>There hasn't been an real audit in more than 30 years.</p><p>Police Brutality, lead in the schools water supply and public housing, the towing scandal, the police evidence locker scandal I could go on and on with what has been allowed to happen by people who have spent 10, 20 and some even 35+ years in office.</p>",
    "q9":"For every contract to be valid, there must be an offer, a consideration, and an agreement----The City doesn't offer services, unless you live in Roland Park, Guilford, Homeland, Homewood or some other affluent white area, but if you're working class, and or poor the City issues dictates.</p><p>When the women of Gilmore Homes were being raped, what service did Paul Grazziano offer to them?</p><p>When the people were complaining about police brutality and murder under color of law, what services did the city offer them?</p><p>What can be done to improve City services, removing every incumbent and their patronage cronies from office is the only thing that will improve city services.</p>",
    "q10":"To end the blood libel against Black youth and men, by the Baltimore Sun and other media with regard to crime and poverty and the medias obfuscation of the Blatant criminality, malfeasance, and misfeasance being committed by the current crop of elected officials in City government.</p><p>I'm running to ensure that the people understand that the current Mayor and City Council have failed in their duty to uphold the Charter of Baltimore City, as well as their failure to abide by the Maryland Declaration of Rights and Article XI of the Maryland Constitution,</p><p>To break the strangle hold that the Greater Baltimore Committee, the Baltimore Metropolitan Council, the Abell Foundations and others have over the formulation of public policy and to disrupt further implementation of \"Baltimore Unbound\" in Baltimore City.</p>",

    "q1":"As a candidate for Baltimore City Council President I am running city-wide. Most, not all, but most of the problems in Baltimore City can be significantly reduced if you look at the root which comes down to two things: economics and education.</p><p>1. Hunger- Baltimore is one of a half dozen or so major urban cities plagued by food deserts. Maryland Senate bill 541 authorizes a food desert tax incentive to attract and retain supermarket in \"retail incentive\" areas throughout the city. If you combine this with growing co-ops and supermarket co-operatives like some other cities with similar issues. Baltimore needs a program like Cincinnati, Ohio's \"Grocery Attraction Pilot Program\"</p><p>2. Homelessness - For the \"economically homeless\" Use the already existing legislation to re-purpose state and city owned properties. Make it a three tier system. The first tier is temporary during individual assessment. Create an individual action plan including both educational and economic options. The second tier implement the individual plan which will include but not be limited to vocational and trade opportunities, move from temporary housing to semi-permanent housing. The third tier is after successfully completing the individual action plan, including financial literacy is to be given the opportunity to own an income based co-op housing unit with all the rights and privileges of home ownership.</p>",
    "q2":"As Baltimore City Council President I would like to see Baltimore enforce laws already on the books to address some of the more urgent policing needs:</p><p>1. more emphasis on apprehending chronic repeat violent offenders.</p><p>2. Require Baltimore City officers to live in Baltimore City.</p><p>3. Police and Community training and pairing for the purpose of creating a Neighborhood Watch in every neighborhood.</p><p>4. Reassessment of necessary resources to decrease the rate of unresolved homicides. Invite in and collaborate with the numerous organizations like \"Open Heart /Close Case Campaign\" which has a network of active and retired multi agency agents and detectives in some cases willing to VOLUNTEER their services in high crime rate areas.</p><p>5. Fix the procedure and process for reporting and finding missing children. I was personally involved in helping a father find his missing fourteen year old daughter. The father was lead to believe he had to wait 48 hours to file a report which he finally did, even though the child was last known to be in the company and car of someone not authorized. There was no Amber Alert, and six days after he notified the school his child was missing they called him a day AFTER she had come to the school saying \"oops\". The system is broken.</p><p>6. I would encourage city wide support of both National Law Enforcement Appreciation Day in January and Police Week in May to acknowledge those officers that consistently go above and beyond for our city.</p>",
    "q3":"The residents of Baltimore City are tired and frustrated. Not just of the perceived racial bias but a whole host of ills including un and under employment, high crime, poorly performing schools, sub standard housing ... The death of Freddy Gray was a tipping point for Baltimore. When you look at cases like Tyrone West and even cases like Officer William Torbit and hear phrases like vestiges of segregation, gentrification, and Institutional Racism it is very difficult to argue racism. However, the city of Baltimore has a bigger problem as evidenced by the prevalence of Black on Black crime shown by last years homicide rate and statistics. Classicism leading to a downward spiral of self-loathing and hopelessness manifesting in senseless acts against ones own. Unless we as a city correct the root issues as I outlined earlier we will continue to say Baltimore doesn't have a war on poverty, Baltimore has a war against the poor. Baltimore is now and has been a city where the \"minority\" is the majority. You don't find \"issues\" in the Black neighborhoods, we as Black people are everywhere in this city. You find the \"issues\" in the predominately Black neighborhoods where the \"POOR\" people are. You don't find lead in the pipes in the schools in Roland Park, there is money there. You don't find drug dealers on the corner there, people have jobs. Fix the root, economics and education. People need hope in the form of a viable and sustainable way out.</p>",
    "q4":"As Baltimore City Council President I would look to see a moratorium on any new or increased taxes until we can get a compete city audit. Taxes are levied as a way for Baltimore to afford the cost of necessary services. Without a complete audit, both performance and fiscal any financial decisions are nothing more than a guess. If we audit and get rid of waste. If we audit and get rid of fraud, we might be able to close the projected 75 million dollar budget gap the Mayor spoke of and fund more youth initiatives without a City Charter amendment like the current City Council President is pushing for. The city of Baltimore needs good solid fiscal stewardship, something it hasn't had in maybe a good 20 years. We as the residents of Baltimore deserve better than that.</p>",
    "q5":"In terms of neighborhood revitalization in neighborhoods away from the water you have to fix the neighborhood key indicators, in other words all the issues that help property value maintain or increase. You get crime down, education up, improve transportation access, increase curb appeal, offer incentives to neighborhood businesses and bring in jobs that stay in the community. In terms of Vacants to Value, I have seen very little value. Lastly it is a sad state of affairs when the state governor once again must rescue a city ravaged and plagued for decades by a one party political machine from its own devices and short sighted policies.</p>",
    "q6":"According to the Greater Baltimore Committee the chief economic barriers to Baltimore city economic development beaks down into four categories.</p><p>- Economic regulation: restrictions on the way businesses can operate, what products and services they can produce and how and where they produce them, price them and market them to consumers</p><p>- Environmental regulation: the costs of complying with environmental statutes</p><p>- Tax compliance regulation: the so-called \"paperwork burden\" costs associated with time and resources required to comply with tax regulations</p><p>- Occupational safety and health regulation: the costs of complying with labor-related laws</p><p>This is important for a few reasons. Sometimes you have to step outside to see in. The best way to address the issues with regards economic development and job creation is not to legislate your way out but listen. In the course of my campaign I recent had the pleasure of meeting a Fell's Point business owner who has been a fixture in Fells Point for over 30 years. He spoke of being frustrated with Baltimore and being just about ready to sell everything and leave. He already no longer lives in the city. We talked for a good hour after the event. From that I made a suggestion that will help him and this city. The business owner asked me not to mention his name quite yet. Stay tuned for a big announcement from Fell's Point within the next few weeks. Sometimes the best way to remove barriers is to listen.</p>",
    "q7":"The structure of city governance is irrelevant without appropriate clear and transparent leadership. As residents of the city of Baltimore, it is incumbent of all of us to do our due diligence in electing leaders. The governance of this great city, state, and country as a whole was created with a system of checks and balances to keep a balance of power. Rather than re-writing as a whole, or amending in part this cities charter we should put in our due diligence in whom we elect and demanding enforcement of the already existing safeguards in place.</p>",
    "q8":"The City Council was focused on the right issues. When asked what were the most important issues the Baltimore city Council has faced in the last four years the only two issues that came to mind were the Casino and the charter amendment in 2012. You tell me, is that good or bad.</p>",
    "q9":"To use a recent example, the city's response to the recent blizzard showed more than weakness. The cites response showed borderline criminal neglect. In Baltimore county residents were given clear time lines and a recourse if there particular street wasn't cleared. No such luck in Baltimore City. You would be hard pressed to find a city where every resident is happy with everything but Baltimore is far from that. During one of the Mayor numerous press conferences someone spoke of a cost of $40,000 an hour to clear the roads. Once again familiar is this theme; a performance audit most residents would say that was not money well spent. Baltimore City has many public service issues and is ill prepared for an emergency of any type whether it be water, sewer, power, or weather. Our city's aging and crumbling infrastructure make it nearly impossible to handle emergencies in a timely manner. We didn't get this way overnight and it won't get fixed overnight. Response time is going to take a team effort. Resident satisfaction however can be drastically improved now with some truth, transparency, and realistic expectations all of which currently seem to be in short supply.</p>",
    "q10":"I am running for Baltimore City Council President to put the charm back in \"Charm City\". Last year's murder rate in the City of Baltimore was not charming. The growing rate of homelessness in Baltimore City is not charming. The lack of educational and economic opportunities in Baltimore City is not charming. I am running for the office of Baltimore City Council President to put real, viable, and sustainable options and opportunities on the table for all Baltimore residents. This city and the residents of Baltimore deserve this city to be a city of inclusion not exclusion and collusion. I am running to bring transparency to government through sound fiscal stewardship and complete and consistent audits. I pledge to empower communities with the resources to redesign their individual communities based on the needs of the residents, and educational opportunities so that all of our children can compete in a global market.</p>"

    "q1":"As an elected official representing a citywide office, I have the pleasure of working toward solutions that benefit citizens across districts and throughout Baltimore. I believe that we have a unique opportunity to build on the successes that we've accomplished during the past several years, and as a result leave a better Baltimore for our younger citizens to inhabit.</p><p>We will be able to accomplish this vision by better preparing our children educationally. The first step toward accomplishing this goal begins with Baltimore City re-establishing full control over its public school system. Doing so, in my opinion, would allow the City Council to hold accountable public school leadership and quickly adjust to changes in the educational needs of our children.</p>",
    "q2":"The strategies to combat Baltimore's violent crime do not begin with our police department. That way of thinking is reactive to the situation instead of proactive. When it comes to violent crime, our best option for reducing the numbers is to start with decreasing the number of citizens that turn to violence. This means early childhood education programs, after-school and recreational programming, adequate college preparation, job training and job creation. These are the elements that lead people down a path of success and prosperity and away from a life of violent crime and our city can and must do more to invest in these opportunities. Our police department is going through a transformation and we must allow time for changes to be implemented and leadership to take action before making assumptions about their effectiveness. As Council President, I would invest in improving our police and community relations through collaborative events, increased foot patrol, and providing incentives for our officers to live in Baltimore and in the neighborhoods they serve. Our police force must think of Baltimore as their home in order to serve the population with the utmost respect and responsibility.</p>",
    "q3":"The death of Freddie Gray, Jr. was a horrible tragedy. But out of that tragedy, a catalyst for change was born. The riots that devastated our city also brought us together in the realization that the residents in our most vulnerable neighborhoods need our support and investment. The events in April also led to a change in leadership of our Baltimore Police Department and a federal investigation of their policies and practices. In the short amount of time since these changes, we've already seen efforts on the part of the police to connect with the community and the termination of officers that have track records of unacceptable behavior. Baltimore is just one of many cities experiencing a wave of change as the discussion of race and equality takes place. We must use this moment to turn our attention and resources toward our citizens who are most in need.</p>",
    "q4":"The tax rate in Baltimore City is discouraging people from moving to Baltimore and crushing our residents financially. Of course taxes are necessary for a city to function. But there is no reason why our taxes should be almost double in comparison to our neighboring counties. I truly believe we need to make lowering the property tax rate in Baltimore City a priority. Tax incentives to encourage development are also necessary to raise the value of surrounding property, entice people to move to the city, and create jobs for our residents to take advantage of. But with these incentives, we must ensure that these businesses are giving back by committing to abiding by my landmark Local Hiring Law, renovating or building in the surrounding areas, and targeting their development in the neighborhoods that need local businesses.</p>",
    "q5":"We can encourage commercial and residential revitalization by requiring the developers that receive a tax incentive to commit real dollars toward community impact agreements and to providing affordable units for rent. We must also offer incentives for business to job train and hire local, including city government. Vacants to Value is a program that is steadily working on eliminating blight in the city and transforming neighborhoods. But it's a program that needs more financial power behind it. I am strongly encouraged by Governor Hogan's willingness to invest in the program. The combination of incentivizing residents and businesses to live and build in our vulnerable neighborhoods, hiring local, and rehabilitating or eliminating vacant homes prescription Baltimore needs to transform itself.</p>",
    "q6":"Baltimore is one of many cities that has struggled to make the transition from an industrial-based workforce to a technology-based workforce. The cycle of poverty and unemployment has impacted our city tremendously. This is why it is more important than ever for government to ensure that job training and job opportunities are available for residents. One way I've done that is through my successful Local Hire Ordinance requiring new city contracts to meet a local hire threshold. But we also have to get the strong private sector in Baltimore on board. This can be done by making arrangements with developments receiving a Tax Increment Financing deal in Baltimore to hire local and invest in our vulnerable and emerging neighborhoods. We also have to invest more in our youth to ensure they are ready for the 21st century job market through after-school programs, high-tech recreational centers, and summer job creation. It is my hope that my Children and Youth Fund will be a catalyst for such change.</p>",
    "q7":"The relationship between the Mayor and the City Council in Baltimore is a constant balancing act. On its face, Baltimore looks like a Mayoral dominated government. But when the City Council can work together and come to a consensus, we are able to be just as strong. I believe that if the Council could override a mayoral veto of a bill with a majority vote instead of a supermajority vote as it stands today, we would be able to pass more legislation and make a greater impact in the city. I also believe that if the members of the Board of Estimates were given equal voting power, the mayor would no longer have the final say about city contracts. Instead, the City Council President, Comptroller, and Mayor would vote equally as members of the board. At the end of the day, it is vital that the mayor and city council communicate and maintain a relationship of respect and openness to successfully serve the citizens of Baltimore.</p>",
    "q8":"The City Council is the voice of the residents of Baltimore. No issue that passes through the council is less important than the next because they affect the daily lives of the residents we serve. In the last four years the city council has made lasting changes to Baltimore City including the Local Hire Ordinance, which requires businesses with new city contracts to meet a local hire threshold, the Body Camera Bill, which will outfit all Baltimore City police officers with a body-worn recording device, and most recently the Children and Youth Fund bill which would designate three percent of the general fund annually to children and youth programs in the city.</p>",
    "q9":"Efficient city services are vital for our residents because it impacts the daily quality of their lives. On a regular basis, thousands of requests come in to our 311 system from pothole repairs to gas leaks and everything in between. The best way to decrease response time for these requests is to constantly update the technology that citizens and city workers use to communicate with each other. The 311 mobile app makes a huge difference for our city workers by providing them with exact locations and photographic evidence in an immediate way. But issues, like multiple requests and responding to those requests when a problem is remedied, still exist. Investing in the latest technology, adequately training our employees, and ensuring the proper number of employees to complete the many requests that come in are just a few ways to improve city services. I like to think of my office as the go-to resource for constituent services. From connecting residents to the proper agency to driving out to a location myself - customer service is first and foremost on my radar as Council President.</p>",
    "q10":"I am running for re-election because I would like to continue working to improve the lives of Baltimore's most challenged citizens and help provide them with the resources to improve their lives and strengthen the communities where we live, work and play.</p>"
