The protest and unrest following Freddie Gray death teaches us that even though we have rules and policies to be we failed to take the necessary steps to abide by those rules. Not just the failure to provide Mr Gray with timely treatment which he asked for during his arrest, but the abandonment of the community by past Mayoral administration which he lived and the system that Freddie Gray was apart of.

We need to rebuild the community's trust in the responsibility of the police to protect and serve us all.

We need to provide a network of support for at-risk juveniles while they are young so they do not commit acts of violence once they are older. And we need to offer an open hand to ex-offenders when they leave prison so they do not revert once again to a life of crime.</p><P>When I was Deputy State's Attorney, we oversaw one of the most dramatic reductions in violent crime in the history of Baltimore, all while cutting arrests in half and diverting thousands of victims of addiction and poverty to the resources and services they so desperately needed, rather than simply throwing them in prison.</p>",

    "q2p2":"<P>No one should be judged or have their future defined by where they come from. But the reality of Baltimore today is that where you come from matters. A child born in Seton Hill has a life expectancy 20 years less than a child born in Roland Park. There are neighborhoods in Baltimore where a child would have a better shot at a long life if they had been born in Syria or North Korea. Nearly a quarter of our city lives below the poverty level. And African Americans are more likely to be arrested for every kind of petty offense, whether it's loitering or marijuana, and they're more likely to be the victims of police brutality.</P><P>This city needs leadership that is capable of dismantling these inequities and forging a new foundation for our future as one City.</p><P>That foundation requires that we re-establish trust between law enforcement and the public. While this will take time, we can still move aggressively for change: mandate body cameras for all police officers, recruit a police force that is of Baltimore, change how we investigate allegations of police misconduct; revive the Civilian Review Board; reform the Law Enforcement Officers' Bill of Rights; provide the right incentives and training for smart policing; and expand educational benefits to officers.</p>",

This flawed framework has had unintended consequences for both addicts and the community as a whole.

After decades of a failed drug policy, it is time for a paradigm altering approach that treats addiction as a disease, and allows our police to focus on the violent criminals and kingpins. And for other minor, non-violent offenders, we need commonsense solutions that reduce incarceration, save taxpayer money, and put people on the path to work. </p>",
    "q3p2":"<P>As Mayor, I will build on my proven record of getting non-violent offenders out of the system, into treatment, and back into the workforce.

Second, I will end arrests for simple possession of marijuana. Third, I will end the cash bail system, a system that is unfair, inefficient, and costs taxpayers unnecessary money by keeping low-risk offenders incarcerated. Fourth, I will invest in specialized programs for mental health, sex work, veterans and the homeless.

We need to reform the state funding formula that punishes our schools for our city's economic development. The funding formula should be linked to tax revenue and not property assessments.</p><p>Second, the Mayor must work with the Board of School Commissioners and CEO to ensure that the school system is managed effectively. Not only is sound management a prerequisite for winning back the support of critics in Baltimore and Annapolis; it is simply fundamental for ensuring our kids have access to the resources and opportunities they need to thrive. And neither the Board nor the CEO have ready access to data across all of the City government, or are able to align all of the agencies that can contribute to doing right by our children. But the Mayor can and the Mayor must.</p>",
    "q5p1":"Baltimore was once a vibrant and prosperous industrial hub, one of the largest cities in the nation and a center for commerce and the arts. But over several decades, profound economic changes led to the staggering loss of two thirds of the city's manufacturing jobs, and one third of the city's population. The city and its residents are still grappling with the implications of these wrenching changes. </p>",
    "q5p2":"<p>But, other cities have taken steps to make their own transition from a once thriving manufacturing town to a new knowledge-based economy, one that can provide renewal and opportunity for all of its citizens. And Baltimore has the assets to do the same: a set of world-class research universities and medical centers that help to seed new companies, and attract existing ones, in emerging industries; a thriving start-up scene with increasingly crowded incubators; a young and energetic population with students more than ever staying in town and new residents moving from out of town. </p><p>However, it takes leadership to harness these possibilities and create the conditions for an economic renaissance, while ensuring that this opportunity extends to every part of the city. My blueprint for growing the economy of our city will involve: investing in workforce development to address the mismatch between workers and jobs; creating the conditions for new companies to take root and existing companies to grow; investing in Baltimore's digital future; easing the burden of taxes to promote competition and growth; and making Baltimore a beacon for immigrants and refugees.</p>",
    "q6p1":"The leaky and crumbling sewer pipes in our city are contributing to an environmental tragedy in the heart of our city.

The harbor is at the same moment one of the city's main tourist attractions, and yet so polluted that the water is unsafe even to touch in many places. There is no doubt that this is a solvable problem: Other cities such as Copenhagen have transformed their own harbor from an environmental blight to an urban oasis, enhancing their mark as a clean and livable city. There is no reason why Baltimore cannot do the same. </p>",
    "q6p2":"<p>I fully support Waterfront Partnership's Healthy Harbor initiative to work towards making the harbor swimmable and fishable by 2020. An investment in a healthy harbor is an investment in a healthy Baltimore. Still, we must acknowledge that while there have been some signs of improvements, the 2014 Healthy Report Card once again gave the harbor an F. And so, this is an area that will require renewed focus. As Mayor, I will ensure that we follow through on the city's wastewater rehabilitation program; strengthen efforts to identity and resolve raw sewage leaks; adding additional water wheel trash collectors; educate the public on their role in keeping our harbor clean.</p>",
    "q7p1":"In a City where approximately 30% of families do not have access to a car, an effective and efficient public transit system is essential to connect citizens to jobs, healthcare, and education. An effective transportation system is critical to the long-term viability of our city, and a precondition to so much else of what the city needs. But, Governor Hogan is now cutting back on these commitments, replacing a planned $2 billion Red Line with a $135 million bus plan and highway spending across the State. These moves were a significant setback for the future of Baltimore. </p>",
    "q7p2":"<p>I will be rolling out a more detailed policy blueprint in the coming weeks, and I invite you to visit my website at www.embry4baltimore for those details. But briefly here: As Mayor, I will advocate for initiatives to make public transit more equitable and affordable, I will press for greater transparency and efficiency within the Baltimore City Department of Transportation, I will seek to expand the reach of public transit, including through an east-west rail connection, and I will seek to develop alternate modes of transportation to connect and grow our City. Finally, Governor Hogan did not consult the affected communities before allocating transportation funding – as we build out a transportation policy in my administration, I will include neighborhoods in the conversation about how transportation resources should be allocated.</p>",
    "q8p1":"I have grave concerns about the leadership in the Housing Authority. From the sex for repairs scandal to deplorable living conditions in public housing, and from the elimination of the agency's Inspector General to reports of retaliation against whistleblowers, the Authority has shown a lack of urgency, leadership, and oversight. Commissioner Graziano will not be part of my administration.</p>",
    "q8p2":"<p>As Mayor, I will continue to participate in the RAD program, which provides an essential revenue stream to pay for the desperately needed maintenance of public housing, but I will take every possible measure to protect the rights of tenants and workers and the availability and affordability of units through the program, and will conduct the program in a transparent manner. And I will continue the Thompson mobility program, which relocates residents of public housing to areas of opportunity, including the suburbs – the program is the result of a court order, and studies indicate it holds great promise for breaking the cycle of poverty and hyper-segregation.</p><p>But we also must do more to promote affordable housing in the city. Among my reforms will be: providing additional property tax relief to persons building new affordable housing projects to support lower rents; imposing greater oversight of the Housing Authority and making it subject to CitiStat; and floating revenue bonds guaranteed by foundations to obtain a lower interest rate for developers to build affordable housing, and to provide direct loans to low-income homeowners for home purchases and rehabilitation</p>",
    "q9p1":"Baltimore's tax rates are among the highest in the nation, placing a staggering burden on homeowners and impeding the ability of the City to attract and retain families and businesses. To promote growth, we need to ease the tax burden, but in a responsible manner that does not open an enormous hole in the budget, jeopardizing our ability to provide public services. The most effective tax reforms will be ones that are responsible, predictable, transparent and equitable. As Mayor, I will complete Mayor Rawlings-Blake's commitment to cut property taxes by a total of 20 cents by 2020 – we are already about 14 cents of the way there – and additional tax deductions will be based on a publicly available rate schedule that is tied to property valuations and revenue.</p>",
    "q9p2":"<p>Tax increment financing (TIF) and payments in lieu of taxes (PILOT) for development projects are among the most powerful tools available to the Mayor to promote smart and equitable economic development. As Mayor, I will not toss aside these tools, at least not in the current tax and budget climate. But no one should expect to receive a TIF or PILOT as a matter of course. I will make changes to ensure that these tools do not become windfalls at taxpayers' expense, including: deploying them in a strategic rather than passive manner and only when their terms benefit the entire city; increasing transparency, auditing and the enforcement of reporting requirements; and strengthening the use of profit sharing and similar requirements.</p>",
    "q10p1":"Vacants to Value has shown promise in neighborhoods such as Oliver and Reservoir Hill, although its impact has been limited to date by an absence of financing and its confinement only to certain middle-market neighborhoods. Project C.O.R.E. could have a profound impact on the future of the city, but as we know from past redevelopment efforts, the challenge is very much in the execution. For one, it will be essential that Baltimore communities play an active role in the strategic planning to reshape neighborhoods, and that Baltimore workers are able to play a role in the demolition and related work that follows.</p>",
    "q10p2":"<p>As Mayor, I will seek to strengthen the Vacants to Value program with stronger leadership and additional capital; expand the use of community land trusts, which empower local nonprofits to take control of vacant buildings and empty land, develop the property, and then retain a stake for the long term benefit of the neighborhood; leverage the 21st Century School Building Plan to promote school-centric neighborhood development; invest in the Healthy Neighborhoods capital pool, which seeks to grow neighborhoods by offering below-market loans in areas plagued by disinvestment; take steps to deepen the city's relationship and partnerships with stakeholders such as anchor institutions (which are increasingly active in driving economic development in Baltimore) and the federal government (which has now provided a $30 million Choice Neighborhood implementation grant to 17 cities, without Baltimore receiving one).</p>",
    "q11p1":"There is little doubt that Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake's handling of the unrest following the death of Freddie Gray while in police custody will figure prominently in her political legacy, and rightfully so. But that chapter, as troubling as it is, does not represent the entire story of her tenure. A fuller account should also highlight the efforts she undertook to take on the fiscal health of the city and the stable leadership she provided in the immediate wake of her predecessor's ouster.</p>",
    "q11p2":"<p>While I deeply respect the mayor for living a life of public service, I have disagreed with her leadership on a number of fronts. One useful lens through which to view these differences is law enforcement, plainly one of the central issues of mayoral leadership. Even the best plans and policies fail when leaders don't invest the time, focus, and energy to make them work. To give one of many examples, the mayor adopted a proven crime-prevention plan called CeaseFire and then quickly let it wither through inattention or indifference. Likewise, CitiStat – a highly lauded data-driven program that has been adopted by cities across the nation – was allowed to disintegrate on her watch.</p><p>As Mayor, my senior team and I will lead our city forward in every area of vital importance to the people of Baltimore, with innovative ideas, rigorous and regular audits and refinement, unfailing fairness for all, and, of course, uncompromised integrity.</p>",
    "q12p1":"Public service has been and will always be my first love, my true calling, and my life's work. I am running for Mayor to end the violence, to expand our economy, and to strengthen our schools. As a public servant and former prosecutor, I will break the vicious cycles of violence and retaliation that have crippled our communities because the bloodshed in Baltimore must end. As a leader and proven manager, I will invest in infrastructure, attract jobs and grow businesses, and get our workforce moving again. And as a daughter of Baltimore who believes in public education, I will reclaim our schools and make sure the promise of a generation is not lost to low expectations.</p>",

Increased accountability helps police work hand in hand with communities, while we allocate resources to our greatest threats.</p>",
    "q2p1":"Many Baltimore residents feel as though their voices have been unheard for far too long, and that they are disconnected from both justice and opportunity. The unrest did not happen overnight. It was a long time in the making, and for decades, City leadership failed to address the lingering ills that led to it. </p>",
    "q2p2":"<p>We are at a crossroads between the past and the future. The City needs leadership with the sense of urgency that making progress now requires, because we cannot continue to let time slip by while residents miss out on the quality of life they deserve. That urgency must be governed by a comprehensive vision for the future, so that we are not dealing with new versions of old problems four years from now. We must also adopt new ideas and new approaches to our most persistent problems, if we are to truly heal them.</p><p>We know our neighborhoods want progress. We know our neighborhoods deserve progress. The question is what will City leadership do to deliver that progress that it has not done in the last 30 years. This election is an opportunity to answer that question.</p>",
    "q3p1":"My 15 Point Plan for Baltimore calls for an investment in vital services like stabilization centers, rapid housing for the homeless, and removing barriers to economic opportunity like criminal records or lack of education. Each represents a stage in addressing addiction, and the path to opportunity Baltimore must create for its residents.</p>",
    "q3p2":"<p>By investing in a critical mass of stabilization centers, Baltimore can place those arrested for public intoxication in an environment that stabilizes their physical condition without creating a mark on their arrest record that only serves as a barrier to recovery, while streamlining the patients' transition into social services that can help them improve their lives. Stabilization centers should provide patients with case management for 30 days after their visit, to ensure they are linked to more longterm health and behavioral treatments, and to shelter assistance if need be. </p><p>Chronic addiction and housing displacement can go hand in hand, and exacerbate one another. Cities across the nation have seen that housing-first programs are not only more humane for residents, but when paired with a social worker, provide the stability and structure residents need to begin the next chapter of their life. Moreover, they deliver better outcomes at lower costs. </p><p>Gainful employment is an important next step for recovering addicts who often experience job instability. My 15 Point Plan emphasizes no-cost expungements for indigent clients, GED preparation and testing at BCCC, vocational training, and City facilitated apprenticeship programs that help residents bridge the gap between obstacles and opportunity.</p>",
    "q4p1":"I support adding elected members to the School Board, and creating a Mayor's Office of Education Reform that oversees City funding of the school system, how it is being spent, and the outcomes it creates. A commitment to improved outcomes is important, but only goes so far if we do not create an apparatus that is responsible for augmenting City Hall's impact on the school system, with a full-time focus on doing so.</p>",
    "q4p2":"<p>An office in City Hall with a full-time focus on education improves the flow of information between North Avenue and City Hall. It allows the mayor to be more informed, and a more informed mayor is a more impactful mayor. The mayor should not be surprised, for instance, to find that there are ghost employees receiving money from the school system. The mayor should always know whether money is being accounted for, where weak points in accountability are, and how City Hall can ensure North Avenue has the resources and assistance it needs to create success. </p><p>The mayor's role can and should be one of raising the bar for educational attainment, and delivering resources for that attainment. My administration will commit to creating social impact bonds for universal pre-k, to bringing City Year to our schools as a support system for vulnerable students, to guiding funds for the creation of magnet middle schools, to creating collaborations with private industry that expose students to the jobs of tomorrow, and to fully incorporating healthcare professionals in our schools.</p>",
    "q5p1":"My 15 Point Plan calls for a focus on workforce development so residents can benefit from job creation while offering companies a ready source of talented workers. It improves the perception of Baltimore's business environment by improving our tax structure, and investing in small businesses and local entrepreneurs. It ensures our residents and businesses benefit from a strong transit infrastructure that allows for an easy flow of people and goods. </p>",
    "q5p2":"<p>Workforce development requires removing barriers to employment by investing in no-cost expungements and baseline educational attainment like GED preparation and testing. My administration will also facilitate apprenticeship programs, while streamlining and augmenting vocational training in high demand sectors like healthcare, IT, and logistics. Finally, my plan institutionalizes the education systems's focus on tomorrow's jobs by scaling Early College High School, making Youth Works a year round program, and introducing a labor advisory committee. </p><p>My 15 Point Plan reduces the property tax rate for non-owner occupied properties to $2.10, and itemizes funds to allow for that reduction. It calls for refocusing the City's enterprise zones on developing neighborhoods, and offering small businesses a tax cut on their first $50,000 in profits. It proposes smart investments like a Citywide fiber optic network, and a small business loan fund focused on neighborhood main streets. My plan includes job access through transportation, which means shuttles to job centers, expanding the Charm City Circulator, putting GPS trackers on MTA buses, piloting bus rapid transit, and creating a connected network of bike lanes with barriers.</p>",
    "q6p1":"Baltimore must expand the number of water wheels in the Harbor to accelerate the rate at which it is cleaned, but also to prevent an accumulation of debris from occurring in the first place. Moreover, the City must do a better job of cleaning up debris in our communities- which includes plastic bags and circulars that are left on vacant doorsteps- so that it does not reach the Harbor to begin with. Cleaner neighborhoods mean a cleaner Harbor. To that end, my 15 Point Plan's emphasis on employing young residents in a year-round cleaning and greening effort will go a long way towards combatting litter in our neighborhoods. </p>",
    "q6p2":"<p>Investing in oyster beds for the Harbor is a fantastic opportunity to combat micro pollutants, as they are one of nature's most effective filtration systems. One oyster can filter 50 gallons of water a day, and in the process, consumes algae and removes nitrogen. Importantly, oysters also represent a natural remedy that helps returns the Harbor to a more fully formed ecosystem. </p><p>Reducing pollution in the Harbor also means dealing more effectively with storm water runoff. My administration will train residents for green jobs and employ them to install green roofs in the City, while also using Toronto's Project Green as a model for public-private partnerships focused on storm water management. My 15 Point Plan also calls for the creation of a Tree Canopy Action Plan, which combined with investments like community gardens, helps expand natural approaches to storm water management.</p>",
    "q7p1":"My administration will rewrite the City's transportation plan, which has not been updated in 12 years. There is no silver bullet for effective transportation infrastructure, but by focusing the plan on a truly multimodal vision for the City, we can create a critical mass of transportation options that ensure all residents have their needs met. </p>",
    "q7p2":"<p>My 15 Point Plan calls for updating the City's Traffic Management Center and Intelligent Transportation Systems to improve traffic flow. That means dynamic traffic lights that react to congestion levels in the moment, or preventing bus \"clumping\" where one bus runs late and another runs early, creating longer wait times in between the buses, to name just a few improvements these systems produce. </p><p>I support piloting bus rapid transit, because it delivers quicker transit times by utilizing features like dedicated lanes, intersection priority, and off-board fare collection. It is also more affordable than railways. Placing the pilots along East-West transit corridors will help connect less well served neighborhoods.</p><p>As explained in question 5, my plan calls for targeted transit expansion like shuttles to employment hubs, but includes a vision for bringing Bikeshare to all Baltimore residents, and creating a connected network of dedicated bike lanes. Strong transportation also means transportation friendly development throughout our neighborhoods though. I support rolling back parking minimums and incentivizing walkable designs in our neighborhood revitalization efforts, to catalyze transportation friendly development. We must also partner with our new businesses to generate responsible funding for expanded Charm City Circulator routes.</p>",
    "q8p1":"My administration will replace Commissioner Graziano, restore the housing department's inspector general, and audit the office. </p>",
    "q8p2":"<p>Any program that might offer federal support is worth considering, but the persistent flaw in Baltimore's implementation of Rental Assistance Demonstration (\"RAD\") has been lack of public awareness and public participation in the process. Such a significant measure should be considered, and if found worthy embarked upon, hand in hand with the thousands of residents and workers who will be most impacted by it. That has simply not been the case in Baltimore. The Housing Department has yet to provide sufficient answers about RAD's impact on longterm affordability for residents, whether residents will be displaced and how displaced residents will be cared for, whether protections are in place for disabled residents, or the impact on wages and benefits for the employees effected. My administration will engage in open, earnest discussions not just on RAD, but on all major housing decisions. </p><p>Moving residents to the suburbs can be helpful in that it might alleviate a concentration of poverty, but it also undercuts the City's ability to grow its tax base by retaining residents, and helping those residents gain the skills and job access they need to flourish. We can develop more affordable housing for residents while also breaking up concentrations of poverty by passing and enforcing a stronger inclusionary housing law. We can also stem the flow of residents in need of affordable housing by reforming the City's tax sale foreclosure system.</p>",
    "q9p1":"My 15 Point Plan for Baltimore reduces the residential property tax rate to $1.80, and to $2.10 for commercial and industrial properties. It also itemizes the funding sources necessary for the reduction. Baltimore should allocate revenue increases from growing property values to the tax cut, and adopt best practices from other cities that deliver services to their residents more efficiently. My plan studies the cost paid by other cities for their services per the number of residents the cities serve, in order to determine where our City's budget is most inefficient relative to other cities. </p>",
    "q9p2":"<p>PILOTs for the City's large tax exempt entities, like hospitals and college campuses, total around $3 million per year. That is less than one tenth of one percent of the City's annual $3.2 billion budget. Instead of struggling with valuable partners over such small (relatively speaking) amounts of money, I will focus on improving service agreements with our anchor institutions. Improved service agreements can mean expanded Live Near Your Work programs, partnerships for security personnel in neighboring communities, or responsibility for rehabbing nearby vacant properties, all of which translate into much more beneficial outcomes for Baltimore's residents. </p><p>Controversy over the use of TIFs cannot be separated from controversy over the neighborhoods that benefit from TIFs. My plan reassigns Baltimore's Enterprise Zones to developing neighborhoods in need of a competitive advantage, and refocuses the Zones' incentives on job creation in manufacturing and emerging technologies. TIFs only work if they work for the average Baltimore resident.</p>",
    "q10p1":"As outlined in question 9, I believe Baltimore must become more targeted in how we distribute our incentives throughout the City, and Enterprise Zones are an important piece of how we distribute our capital. My administration will steer those incentives and the development they attract towards neighborhoods that need a competitive advantage. </p>",
    "q10p2":"<p>Vacants to Value has a sound internal structure, but does not achieve the impact it is capable of because it scatters our resources and new development thinly across the City, giving them minimal impact. My administration will create Building on Leveraged Development (BOLD) Zones that target programs like Vacants to Value around undervalued neighborhood anchors, while focusing partnerships with private equity in those areas. This approach allows the City to create a critical mass of investment that can revitalize a community more quickly. That means more communities will either have a robust area of growth or be next door to a growth area that will radiate into it, instead of so many communities seeing only marginal progress. </p><p>Teardown efforts like Governor Hogan's are necessary to an extent. The key is using them as a scalpel, not an ax that consumes a forest of homes without having a plan for the infill that must follow. Teardown efforts must focus on properties that are not structurally sound, and that would cost more to rehab than to build anew. My administration will also focus on redevelopment that is mixed-use in order to create walkable communities that are more resilient to change.</p>",
    "q11p1":"It is difficult to define a legacy in the moment, especially when that legacy is still being written. Time will provide clarity to Mayor Rawlings-Blake's impact on Baltimore. </p>",
    "q11p2":"<p>What Mayor Rawlings-Blake did well and what she did poorly maps onto how we would be similar and how we would be different. Mayor Rawlings-Blake cares for Baltimore, and wants to do well for the citizens of Baltimore. Delivering for the citizens of Baltimore requires communicating effectively and being present. For instance, a good idea only helps our residents if enough people can be convinced of its merit and are willing to support its implementation. That means the mayor must communicate well with residents, and make sure they know their mayor is there day in and day out for as long as it takes to get the job done. </p><p>My administration will share Mayor Rawlings-Blake's concern for the City, but go to great lengths to participate in an ongoing dialogue with our residents and to engage in their everyday quality of life. Just as importantly, by engaging effectively with Baltimoreans every day, my administration will be situated to better work with community members on creating and implementing the new ideas they need and deserve to build a better Baltimore.</p>",
    "q12p1":"As a lifelong Baltimore resident, I have seen the best of Baltimore and I have seen the worst of Baltimore. Our City is at a crossroads between the two, and we must decide whether to commit to the new energy and new ideas that can build a better future for us all, or to continue the insufficient policies of the past. I have worked with experts throughout the City to create a comprehensive plan that can build that better future, where education, public safety, strong jobs, transportation, healthy neighborhoods, and a reformed government connect with one another in a cohesive vision for decades to come. I believe every Baltimore resident deserves that better future, and look forward to building it with them.</p>",

I learned that too many people have little faith in our city to correct injustices or improve neighborhoods that have been neglected for decades. Many people including seniors who have watched their neighborhoods change from communities of pride to drug infested corners with little hope. We must restore trust in our police by the community and respect of our citizens by the police in an effort to reduce crime and protect our neighborhoods. Listening to the voices every day as I stood in solidarity with the community I also learned that many in those neighborhoods have not given up hope and are willing to work to save their communities. I would assume the responsibility of restoring faith in our system of justice and will empower our community leaders to work with me to help erase the blight and build communities that they can once again be proud of. As Mayor, I will bring opportunity to neighborhoods across the city; revitalizing commercial corridors removing blighted houses and creating a safe walkway to schools so everyone can have a sense of pride in their community.

While we collect, structure and analyze the data we must determine what works and what does not.</p>",
    "q3p2":"<p>Part of our strategy has to include community engagement. We must teach drug prevention in our schools. We must break the cycle of generation after generation engaging in drug activity and becoming addicted. We must build family bonds and target vulnerable communities. Drug addiction is an illness and we must treat it as such, however we must recognize that treatment on demand is not readily accessible. With 10,000 inmates returning to our city annually and nearly 70% suffering from substance abuse, we must work cooperatively with our state and federal government to seek support for their re-entry.</p><p>The Office of Returning Citizens, that I will establish, will ease their return into our community having assessed their needs.

The quality of a school system is also a factor when families decide where to raise their children. Many families with school age children don't choose Baltimore to live. We can change that by creating a quality school system with accountability that will provide our children a world class education from the cradle to college and careers.</p><p>As Mayor, I will evaluate the school budget and establish a goal of increasing our contribution to the city school budget to 35% over the next four (4) years. We know learning begins in the womb – we must collaborate with the medical community to increase infant learning capacity. My education plan calls for an increase in the availability of Judy Centers and Universal Pre-K. With public private partnerships, we can create year round Job and Intern Programs, expand learning methodologies, increase technology (in the classroom and measuring outcomes), explore student remediation strategies and advance placement programs, and align vocational curriculum with 21st century careers.

    "q7p1":"Baltimore transportation policy has been one of doing a little bit of everything but not doing it well. About 30 percent of the city's land is public right-of-way, maximizing that 30 percent is what leads to economic development & jobs, better public safety and a better quality of life for Baltimoreans. Nearly one-third of Baltimore residents lack access to a car making access to public transit an essential element toward the path of upward mobility. I am disappointed that the Red Line has been scrapped by the Hogan Administration, but we can work together to connect residents with job centers. I want to ensure that Baltimore has a rapid bus system that links all of the neighborhoods so residents can go to and from work with greater ease in less time. Along with the Governor, I support the potential of a Maglev rail system. Let's explore new options of mass transit such as the NASA created skyTran (a personal rapid transportation system). I also believe we can make the circulator sustainable and I will work to expand the MARC hours of operation so people can not worry about getting home after a long day of work. We have a good bike transportation plan that has never been implemented. That will change under the Pugh Administration.

It is important that the city control some of its public housing to assure that those who do not have access to housing are accommodated in a fair and equitable way. I don't agree with moving city residents to the suburbs. We must create low, middle and upper income housing to accommodate all our citizens. Baltimore is a city that has shrunk from over a million people to 620,000 and is in need of growth. The city has too many vacant abandoned homes which is an opportunity for us to create incentives for mixed income neighborhood development, introduce special tax districts, create vibrant senior living communities and establish a land bank.

I will create an out of the box strategy for existing businesses to expand into new locations in business corridors in your neighborhood. We will invest in existing small businesses to expand, providing financial support and rent subsidies for second locations in neighborhood commercial corridors with fewer retail and service establishments. Channeling neighborhood appropriate commercial development and mixed-used development corridors will enable us to strike the balance between preserving the Baltimore we love while enabling us to continue to attract new residents and businesses without sacrificing what is best for Baltimore City residents. The Vacants to Value program has some merit; however, we need to scale the program to more rapidly remove blight and rebuild our communities.

When nearly 60 percent of the residents in Sandtown are unemployed it is a clear indication that we need job training, in high school and in partnership with local businesses and nonprofits; GED classes and night school; and support systems for social services, mental health, and childcare. The approach must be holistic and comprehensive. Sandtown also has the highest number of residents incarcerated in all of the state of Maryland at an approximate cost of $17 million. What if we worked with the state to redistribute even a portion of those funds and used it for job training, after school time programming, rec centers, GED classes? We could reduce the number of those incarcerated significantly and use that money much more wisely, morally and humanely.</p>",

Hamsterdam was a defined area set up in an unpopulated area where drugs could be used legally. The area would be patrolled by the police and nonprofits, government agencies, and health institutions would offer services and counseling. Drugs would be prescribed by health professionals. Addicts would use clean needles and receive treatment on demand. Drug addiction is a disease. This is a public health matter not a criminal matter. This general assembly, Delegate Dan Morhaim introduced a bill to establish \"safe consumption areas.\" It is clear that the medical and greater community understand this as a public health issue and I would offer the full support of the city on such legislation. Methadone is a controversial way of treating drug addiction because it too is addictive. However, this drug allows a person to function, to hold down a job and support their family. What is needed is better oversight of the facilities to protect the patients and the adjacent communities. In addition to treatment, there must be other support services onsite. When mayor, one of my goals is to re-train our police officers in community policing. They should be equipped to know about neighborhood resources and organizations to refer those in need. They need to know that drug addicts are sick. Illegal sales will not be allowed. Property and personal crimes committed by addicts to support their habit will be prosecuted.</p>",

Every appointment to the School Board since 1997 has been done by the mayor with the consent of the governor. On paper, it may say joint, but not once has the governor disputed the mayor's recommendations. So I see the mayor as leadership and no, I don't have confidence. I believe that the mayor should own, be accountable and responsible for our city schools' performance. The Commissioners are appointed by the mayor, and there is where the current disconnect lies. It's not even a matter of hierarchy, it's a matter of working together, leading as a mayor with known expectations of what the school system needs to accomplish. And, the mayor and City Council must increase funding to the schools to a minimum of 30 percent of the city's operating budget over the next four years as opposed to the current 11-13 percent. There should be a partially-elected Board of Commissioners, which gives the general public a voice and a sense of ownership. Eighty-five percent of the Baltimore city public school population is poor and black and there is not one member on the Board who is both poor and black. A partially-elected Board allows for someone who is living the life of the majority of our students and their families an opportunity to have a voice.</p>",

Another area of growth is the local/regional food economy. Creating a business-friendly environment will include establishing effective locally-based programs and resources using Choice Neighborhoods, tax incentives, and targeted community funding to name a few. In addition, we must decrease the property tax rate and lower or altogether eliminate many of the fees that serve as a roadblock to success for many businesses. Our schools need to be resources for skilled workforce training. Not every graduate goes on to college. In fact, less than half according to a 2012 study. Working with businesses, we must prepare our youth and unemployed adults for careers not just a job. Baltimore is a tough town when it comes to starting a business and that has to stop. We need a streamlined process, less unnecessary paperwork, and fewer fees.

I propose that there be a much lower or no fee. The current fee structure is ambiguous. The audits ongoing in the Department of Public Works will reveal additional funds that can be re-prioritized to pay for this work. If we cannot remove the fee altogether, we must better publicize the limited income and pollution reduction activities for individuals and businesses to receive credits. Secondly, we need to build a critical mass of environmental stewards. And how do we do that? I will fully support the proposed CleanCorp Baltimore program through the Office of Sustainability. Based on the city's highly effective Energy Challenge, this is the best approach to educating our residents and businesses on how to change their behavior to reduce their impact on the harbor. City government needs to do its part. We will hire more inspectors who deal with housing and trash issues; replace or retrofit the inefficient corner trash cans with containers similar to those in Charles Village; increase street cleaning; and provide recreational programs like kayaking and canoeing because you can't care about something you haven't experienced.

First, we need to work with the state on the efficiency of the MTA bus system. The current BaltimoreLINK proposal has started the discussion but their method is not the answer. One answer lies in routes within routes. A bus that runs from White Marsh to UMBC will never run on time. Some buses on that route should run the entire way with fewer stops in order to keep it moving and then a few of buses on the same line should loop shorter routes from White Marsh to Hopkins, from Hopkins to University Center, and from University Center to UMBC. Baltimore has several options to move citizens from north to south. Moving people east and west is much more fragmented. A modern street trolley on North Avenue, Baltimore's widest boulevard that connects riders with north/south transportation, is a clean and efficient solution. Any changes and improvements to mass transit must focus on taking citizens from their homes to where the jobs are located. Amazon, which has 3,000 employees, needed to set up a shuttle from downtown so employees don't have to take several buses over two hours to get to work. Then the city subsidized it. The MTA should run the shuttle or subsidize it, not the city.</p>",

This was caused by a lack of leadership by both the mayor and commissioner â€“ bad leadership. The issue of privatizing our public housing by the Obama Administration is a result of many years of the federal government reducing its support for public housing. Local governments around the country had little choice but to participate in the program if they wanted to modernize what has become obsolete housing. Whether this approach is successful only time will tell. We are too quick to advocate for the relocation of our economically challenged families. Many of these families don't want to leave their communities where they have extended families and places familiar to them. Is it impossible to ask that we provide quality educational opportunities and safety in our city neighborhoods that rival their suburban counter parts? The question should be how do we work to fix the problems causing people to leave. For new construction, with 20 or more units, at least 15 percent of the units must be offered below market rate and of those a significant portion should be available to low to middle income citizens referred through nonprofits and the housing department.</p>",

Seniors and income limited homeowners will have caps as allowed by city and state programs. 2) accepting Smart Growth funding state aid, as has been provided in several other states that lasts over a 2-3 year window; 3) partnerships with nonprofits (not houses of worship) that receive city services especially for our large institutions (in other cities, universities and hospitals pay a voluntary fee to the city). I have stood virtually alone in saying no to wealthy developers receiving huge tax breaks with no direct benefit to the communities. As Chair of the Taxation, Finance and Economic Development Committee, no tax incentive will move favorably by the committee unless tangible and direct resources are provided to the most vulnerable communities around these developments and priority will be given to programs in the outer harbor areas.

I will establish a working group of financiers and community leaders that will create a community lending institution to support the goals and objectives of communities with realistic plans for development, as is done in Cincinnati. There are many small developers working in our communities to reclaim vacant houses and they all have the same lament. In order to do business, they must go through an onerous, lengthy review process with reviewers who don't understand development. I am committed to building a streamlined transparent review process. We must move the vacant housing for its worth, $0, into the hands of responsible developers and homeowners with the means to rehab. If we want to bring back our neighborhoods by eliminating vacant housing, we need to get them onto the tax rolls. The sale of houses needs to be planned so that scattered vacant houses in \"cusp\" neighborhoods are quickly sold and put into the hands of homeowners and where there are blocks of vacant houses, the entire block is sold to be renovated.

Failure of government to act within the boundaries of law always lead to citizens feeling the need to do the same. Baltimore's economy was kept stagnant by public policy from Baltimore City Hall. Killing our local economy was to no citizens' interest. When the industrial economic base left over a few decades the policy would have been to rebuild small business and small manufacturing factories to fill this economic void. Baltimore politicians chose to leave the economy stagnant and to allow communities to crumble. This is tied to the Master Plan of Baltimore having Baltimore as an International Economic Zone with global corporations coming into the region. None of this is what citizens want and it was not worth the decades of economic stagnation, high unemployment, and poverty that created the black market economies across the city bringing citizens like Freddie Gray into brushes with criminal justice.

Development in the city is too geared toward global corporate campuses and dismantling of grand green spaces. A goal of city density does not have to be partnered with privatization of all public space and building right to the edge of our Baltimore Harbor. These are wetlands that should be natural. Baltimore has allowed a trillion dollars in development funds over a few decades go to building global corporate campuses that could easily have paid to rebuild our water and sewage pipelines at a few billion dollars. Neglecting that has created grave environmental and public health concerns all unnecessary. It is this failure of our street drainage and broken water and sewage pipeline that constantly sends fresh water, waste, and chemical pollutants leading to dead zones, algae blooming, and accumulated chemical contamination of our coastal bottom.

We must grow the use of MTA buses with strong and reliable service, with lots of buses on routes so waits fall to 20 minutes on average, and encourage local corporations to make an annual bus pass part of employee benefits. Poverty in Baltimore has too many people without private means to work so growing wages allows employees choices in accessing jobs. Buses, taxis, light rail must all be brought together in connecting schedules to reduce time to and from any destination. If we do not fix all of the above with the public transit infrastructure already in place expanding to a Red Line would be premature as it is. The Red Line is not dead----it is delayed and that gives time to strengthen our existing transit. I do not want Hogan's plan of rapid commuter buses to privatize our city transit which the current plans do.

Baltimore has plenty of Federal housing revenue to have rebuilt much of the surrounding communities twice but decades of housing funds were misappropriated. Stopping this will fuel community demolition and rehabbing of houses for citizens living in these communities and offer lots of relocation opportunities in areas wanting to gentrify. Gentrification has always occurred so it is not bad it simply needs to be done with justice allowing citizens having lived for generations in Baltimore to remain attached to the city. We must end concentrated poverty by making sure mixed-income development is REAL done so that rents are fixed to remain affordable not to the market----but to the wage data. Maintaining equal opportunity and access housing; creating pockets of fixed rent housing; using land trusts in small pockets in every community will build real mixed-income structure into what will be widespread surrounding community development.

That will immediately turn Lexington Market into a transportation and economic hub that connects people to each other, and to employment opportunities in the region.</p><p>Making that a reality requires two things: vision, and a little bit of courage. Large-scale transportation projects shouldn't get Baltimore caught in partisan fights. Rather, Baltimore should be a regional leader in building the transportation network of the future. That means we need to be at the table in Annapolis, and with our federal partners, both of which bear a significant cost in the construction of large-scale projects. I like to say, \"If you're not at the table, you're probably on the menu.\"</p>",
    "q8p1":"We have made great progress in many neighborhoods around Baltimore, but we aren't anywhere close to where we need to be. When I think about the mortgage and rental discrimination in Baltimore, it makes me sick. When I think about our Housing department treating residents with disrespect, it makes me sick. </p>",
    "q8p2":"<p>First, we have to clean up Housing and get it working for the people again. For too long, leadership at Housing hasn't had the best interests of our city's residents in mind. The citizens of Baltimore, including our public housing residents, should be treated with respect, and that means holding agency leaders accountable for their promises, including eliminating vacant buildings, keeping housing affordable, and eliminating the long-standing discrimination that has hurt Baltimore's families. We have to use all the tools in our toolbox, including incentives for affordable housing and enforcement of inclusive housing regulations, to rebuild our neighborhoods. There is nothing more fundamental to families stability than secure, safe, affordable housing.</p><p>But fundamentally, we will never uplift our most distressed communities without jobs, education and economic opportunity. To turn Baltimore around, we need new leadership that puts neighborhoods first and grows jobs and opportunity, so that Baltimore can be a place where the life expectancy of our children is no longer dictated by zip code.</p>",
    "q9p1":"Our city is at a crossroads. This election will be the difference between writing the greatest turnaround story in America, or slipping backwards into permanent decline. Our city's high tax rate is often mentioned as the reason more businesses and families don't invest in Baltimore.</p>",
    "q9p2":"<P>And it's true: Our city's tax rate is high, and typical politicians are racing to see who can make the biggest cut. But I believe that before we make promises about the tax rate, we have to understand where we're spending our money. Our city pensions are on the way to going broke. Baltimore has not had regular, public audits since 1983, when William Donald Schaefer was mayor. No responsible manager can promise tax cuts without fully understanding our city's finances. This lack of accountability is not respectful to the people who invest their hard-earned tax dollars in Baltimore, and promising cuts before we fully understand the issue is even more disrespectful.</p>",
    "q10p1":"Today, programs intended to rehab vacant houses are weak and ineffective. For too long, the power brokers at Housing haven't had the best interests of the city's residents in mind. </p>",
    "q10p2":"<p>To strengthen neighborhoods, we not only have to clean up Housing and commit to tearing down and redeveloping vacant properties, we have to provide real incentives to build and maintain affordable housing for low and middle-income families. I will work with Gov. Hogan to not only ensure we remove the blight from every neighborhood in our city, but that we also protect and look out for the residents who live there now. </p><p>But we can do more than that. I see Baltimore's housing problem as an opportunity that will allow us to give thousands of people in this city workforce training, and create jobs that rebuild and revitalize our communities. </p><p>And to grow Baltimore, we need every tool in our neighborhood revitalization toolbox. If you get a TIF, or a tax break, under my administration, you also get a rec center -- and for the life of that TIF, that rec center is yours to maintain and staff. There will be no more financial contracts, without social contracts. In my administration, you won't be able to reap the fruits of the Inner Harbor without planting seeds in east and west Baltimore.</p>",

These are opportunities that have been missed by virtually every elected politician, for decades. </p><p>Politics as usual has failed Baltimore. It's time for a new direction.</p>",

    "q1p1":"As Mayor, public safety will be my top priority. Reducing violent crime is essential so that residents feel safe in their communities. An innovative tool that I would bring to Baltimore to reduce gun violence is a state of the art gun detection system. A gun detection system would provide near instantaneous notification, and provide law enforcement with the exact location of a shooter, direction of a shot, and even detect the type of gun used. A gun detection system could reduce gun incidents by up to 49%. I also understand that part of the work to reduce violent crime will be to support evidence-based initiatives like Baltimore's Safe Streets program. With sufficient resources, programs like Safe Streets can help to reduce crimes in communities throughout the City. However, the only long-term solution to reducing crime is by helping communities build wealth and expand opportunities. Police-community relations will not improve until we start hiring and training officers who live in the communities they serve. As Mayor, I will provide incentives for police officers to live in the City, and promote programs that encourage mentorship between police officers and our youth. Law enforcement must have a stronger connection to the communities they serve in order for police-community relations to improve.</p>",

There is an absence of bold community-focused leadership, and if we elect politicians like Sheila Dixon, Nick Mosby, Catherine Pugh or Carl Stokes, we cannot expect a different result. Their leadership will only lead us to more unrest, more disappointment, and more of the same. For too long, we have experienced the cycle of poverty, inequality, injustice and violence that have held our City back. After the death of Freddie Gray, I knew I had to step up to bring the community together and fight for those who continue to get left behind.</p>",

As Mayor, I will focus on strategies that reduce drug addiction by helping people get treatment while also training them with the skills they will need to find meaningful employment. Police officers can and should be trained to treat addiction as an illness and condition of poverty, and not a crime. When a police office is confronted with a person experiencing addiction they should connect that person with the care and services the individual needs to move away from drug addiction.</p>",

For decades, Baltimore City Public School has failed to properly educate residents of Baltimore. I will advocate for a new governance structure that will include a partially elected school board. I will make universal Pre-K a reality, and will devote resources that will increase funding for Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) programs. After I received an engineering degree from NYU, I had so many high paying job opportunities. But I knew that my personal success was not enough, I had to come back to the City that raised me because I knew that we must do better for our children. A focus on STEM programs, with a goal of making every student proficient in algebra by 7th grade and calculus by 11th grade, will only help our students succeed in college and expand their career opportunities.</p>",

We need to change the governance structure of our school board, devote funding for STEM programs and make universal Pre-K a reality. We also need to streamline services for small business so that it is easier to turn a Baltimore-born idea into a business opportunity. But even then, local entrepreneurs face barriers in the form of access to capital to launch their business. The City can provide micro-financing loans and grants to individuals to help start their local business and create local jobs.</p>",

Burning waste will only increase pollution levels and emit hazardous chemicals that are connected to cancer, heart disease, asthma and other respiratory problems.

It will be a top infrastructure priority that will pay for itself over time and that will provide residents with skilled jobs. For an economy to grow, people need to be able to get where the jobs are. As Mayor, I will work with the Baltimore City Delegation, and other State legislators to bring partial funding for a new and improved subway system. I will work advocate at the federal level to find federal dollars, and will work with the private sector, especially large corporations in Baltimore to incentivize investment in a state of the art subway system. We need to move from being a city of neighborhoods to a world-class metropolitan city where neighborhoods interconnect.</p>",
