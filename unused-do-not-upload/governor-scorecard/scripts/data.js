{"name":"mizeur","dream-act":"yes","gay-marriage":"yes","high-earners":"yes","casino-expansion":"no","death-penalty":"yes","offshore wind":"yes","gun-control":"yes","gas-tax":"yes","minimum-wage":"yes","marijuana":"yes","dream-act-response":"I was a proud co-sponsor of the Dream Act when it passed the General Assembly and worked hard to help secure passage when it went to referendum in 2012. If your parents pay taxes in Maryland and you graduate high school in good standing, you should not have to pay out-of-state tuition for college. It was the fair thing to do and it now allows thousands of Marylanders to get the skills they need to contribute to our economy. ","gay-marriage-response":"Winning marriage equality was personal for me and my wife. My work began in 2004 when as a City Councilmember, I helped Takoma Park become the first municipality to pass a resolution in support of same-sex marriage.   Deborah and I worked hard to openly show my colleagues our love and commitment to one another, breaking down the walls of fear that prevented full equality. In Annapolis, I was a consistent vocal champion, advocate, and co-sponsor of marriage equality legislation each year.  The first breakthrough came in 2011, when marriage equality won passage in the state Senate. During the House floor discussion that year, I gave an impassioned address that Baltimore Magazine credited as â€œone of the most memorable [floor] speechesâ€ of the marriage equality debate.  Though the legislation came up short in 2011, I played a leading role with my colleagues in the LGBT caucus to help secure its passage in 2012. I was among those lobbying undecided colleagues in the final days before the vote in House of Delegates, as has been cited by The Baltimore Sun.  After passage in the General Assembly, I spent six months working to secure victory on Question 6 at the ballot box. I traveled to every corner of the state to rally volunteers and find supporters. I funded Question 6 ballot issue outreach videos to win support, opened up my personal offices for weekly phone banks, and helped raise campaign funds to win the referendum effort. ","high-earners-response":"I voted for this package to increase revenue for critical public services, but we still have a lot to do in order to achieve a fair income tax system. As I detailed above, I have a plan to give 90% of Marylanders a tax cut by instituting a millionaireâ€™s tax. ","casino-expansion-response":"Marylandâ€™s political leaders bet the farm on adding table games to our existing slots parlors and constructing a mega-casino in Prince Georgeâ€™s County. In doing so, they asked Marylanders to double down on a flawed economic strategy that has already proved to be worth far less than advertised. Powerful gaming interests want you to believe that this is our only hope for new jobs in this difficult economy. But we know better.  Casino interests have promised up to 4,000 jobs with this expansion â€” an attractive number if these would be new jobs. But given that casinos typically attract 80 percent of their customers from within a 50-mile radius, a form of economic redistribution is more likely. Most of the jobs would slowly but surely be taken from existing local retail, dining and hospitality businesses.  A gaming expansion was a short-term fix that distracted us from the work of creating sustainable jobs and growing our middle class.  ","death-penalty-response":"I was proud to cosponsor this legislation in the House of Delegates. I co-authored an op-ed in The Baltimore Sun with Sister Helen Prejeanâ€”a national death penalty repeal advocateâ€”to argue for its repeal.  The irreversibility of the death penalty requires an absolute certainty in capital cases that we cannot possibly obtain. Life in prison without the possibility of parole is a fairer approach to punishment. Put simply, the death penalty did not make us safer; did not save us money; it did not work; and it could not be fixed.  As governor, I will commute the sentences of the four remaining death row inmates to life without parole. Until then, the death penalty is not truly repealed.  ","offshore-wind-response":"I was a cosponsor of this legislation. I have also proposed several clean energy actions in my jobs plan, including an increase Maryland's renewable portfolio standard to 40% by 2025, the creation of a Green Building Loan Program, and making Maryland a wind energy manufacturing hub.","gun-control-response":"When did we become apathetic about gun violence in our communities? There is a sense recently that gun violence is the new normalâ€”whether itâ€™s everyday on the streets of Baltimore or a mass shooting in a school or a mall. We cannot stand for that.   Last year, we passed one of the countryâ€™s most comprehensive gun safety packages but we missed some important measures. When Iâ€™m Governor, Maryland will become the 7th state with truly universal background checks for all guns.  The key to driving down gun violence is keeping them out of the hands of violent criminals. To that end, we willl also require the removal of guns from domestic violence scenes and invest in local gun buyback programs statewide.   We can stop senseless gun violence by having the courage to pass better laws. We have to do more.  ","gas-tax-response":"See question 8 for more details.","minimum-wage-repsonse":"I applaud the General Assembly for making strides this year in raising the minimum wage, but the bill got so watered down that the next governor will be running for re-election before it goes above $10 an hour. Our workers should not have to wait that long for a raiseâ€”they have waited long enough.  To make matters worse, the bill was stripped of two critically important provisions: raising the tipped worker minimum wage to 70% of non-tipped workers and indexing the wage to cost of living increases. I stood on the House floor to offer an amendment to reinstate the indexing provision, but it was voted down by legislators who feared challenging Annapolis establishment leaders. This is what we can expect with more of the same: politics over progress.   No one who works 40 hours a week should be living in poverty. That's why I have a plan to bring a true living wage to Marylandâ€”$16.70 by 2022â€”to match the existing â€œliving wageâ€ for state contractors and subcontractors. It will be implemented gradually so that businesses can predict and plan ahead of time. Once it reaches $16.70, it will then increase each year with inflation.

We should not use ranking that count how much we spend on education.  Rather it should be only on how well students learn.  We have been unfriendly to manufacturing and trades and thus lost our trade schools. People need skills. I went to a trade school and worked my way through college.","gay-marriage-response":"","high-earners-response":"","casino-expansion-response":"","death-penalty-response":"This took away a tool the states attorney's used as a bargaining chip to have a suspect give helpful information which led to the finding of those who assisted in murders, rapes, and other horrendous crimes. ","offshore-wind-response":"To costly and not workable. Raises utility bills. Instead I put forward an idea of mine that the Navy is proceeding with, wind turbines on the north shore of the mouth of the Severn.  There is already a grid in place and there is I showed there is no additional cost to rate payers. It would help supplement the grid. Whereas, The offshore project is destined to drive up energy costs. The heavy storms, the inability to store the energy properly, and other issues makes the off shore wind location very costly and hard to store the energy.","gun-control-response":"As a jewelry store owner, I know the fear when you sense your store being targeted.  Jewelers homes have been targeted.  The process in Maryland is too cumbersome  to obtain a defensive weapon.  People should not have to wait so long when they feel a need to urgently defend themselves.  ","gas-tax-response":"Very aggressive tax.The Governor robbed the dedicated funds for transportation.  He then backfilled it with bond bills helping to create a structural debt service (credit card fees) of 1.05 billion a year.  He robs it and then says, oh my, we have to raise the gas tax.","minimum-wage-repsonse":"Every study from congressional budget office to George Mason showed convincingly that the job loss from this would be horrific.","marijuana-reponse":"I supported the medical marijuana bills in their limited use and supported expanding it to children with seizures if the THC drug part was taken out and it has high amounts of canabidial.  But my background in Clinical Psychology tells me not to go further. That use among young with developing brains with increase. I am for the RSAT bills"},
