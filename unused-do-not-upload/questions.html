<P>Statewide, Maryland voters are asked to consider two constitutional amendments. The first would put state transportation <a href="http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/politics/campaign-2014/bs-md-transportation-lockbox-20140920-story.html" target="_blank">funds in a “lockbox,”</a> making it harder for legislators to divert the money to other purposes. The second would give Baltimore and Maryland’s 23 counties the legal authority to hold a <a href="http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/politics/campaign-2014/bs-md-special-elections-20141023-story.html" target="_blank">special election for mayor or county executive</a>, if local lawmakers choose to enact such legislation.</p>
